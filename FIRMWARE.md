# Building our own firmware package (OS included) - full analysis + gameplan

Supersedes `NETWORKING.md` §6's shorter answer to the same question, after the user pointed at two
things that materially change the picture: (1) the real OS running here (corrected below), and
(2) official Ingenic vendor documentation for this exact chip/kernel generation already sitting in
`~/Documents/guppyscreen/docs hw/` - unreviewed until this pass. Everything below is read-only
findings (device queried live, idle, no writes) plus documentation review - **nothing has been
flashed, built, or changed on the device.**

## 1. Correcting the OS assumption - it's Buildroot, not Ubuntu

Checked directly on the live device: `/etc/os-release` reads:

```
NAME=Buildroot
VERSION=2020.02.1-g1ad352d2bd-dirty
ID=buildroot
VERSION_ID=2020.02.1
PRETTY_NAME="Buildroot 2020.02.1"
```

This is [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/), not Ubuntu - a lightweight, source-based embedded
Linux build system, not a general-purpose distro. This is actually *better* news for "more
lightweight, more up to date" than Ubuntu would have been: Buildroot is already about as minimal as
it gets, extremely well-documented, and - critically - it's confirmed to be the *exact* system
already in use here (see §3), so building our own updated image means using the same, familiar
tool the vendor already used, not introducing a new one.

## 2. Exact hardware + reference platform, now fully mapped

- **SoC**: Ingenic X2000 (XBurst II, MIPS32R2) - confirmed multiple ways: `/proc/cpuinfo`
  (`system type: xburst2-based`), and now also directly from the live device tree:
  `/proc/device-tree/compatible` = `ingenic,x2000_module_base` + `ingenic,x2000`.
- **Reference board family**: Ingenic's own "Halley5" X2000 evaluation board (see §3) - Creality's
  Nebula Pad is a customized board built on this reference design, standard practice for these
  vendor SoCs.
- **Storage layout, fully mapped this session** (`/proc/partitions` + `mount`, all read-only):
  ```
  mmcblk0p1  1 MiB    (likely xboot/bootloader - small, matches ref. table's "xboot" role)
  mmcblk0p2  1 MiB    (likely a paired/backup slot for p1)
  mmcblk0p3  4 MiB    (likely kernel/boot - paired with p4)
  mmcblk0p4  4 MiB    (likely kernel/boot backup, or dtb)
  mmcblk0p5  8 MiB    (likely dtb or another paired slot)
  mmcblk0p6  8 MiB    (paired with p5)
  mmcblk0p7  500 MiB  (candidate: squashfs rootfs image, "/rom")
  mmcblk0p8  500 MiB  (candidate: paired/backup rootfs slot - real A/B redundancy)
  mmcblk0p9  300 MiB  ext4, mounted at /overlay - the writable overlay layer (see below)
  mmcblk0p10 ~6 GiB   ext4, mounted at /usr/data - the actual persistent user-data partition
                       (printer_data, Klipper config, our own RosetteOS install all live here)
  ```
  Exact p1-p8 role assignment is inferred from size/position matching the Halley5 reference
  `partitions.tab` layout (§3), not yet confirmed byte-for-byte - a real next step, not a risk in
  itself (read-only to confirm).
- **Root filesystem architecture - genuinely reassuring for experimentation risk**: `mount` shows
  `/dev/root` mounted read-only as squashfs at `/rom`, with `mmcblk0p9` (ext4) providing a writable
  `overlayfs` upper layer mounted as `/` itself. This is a standard, safe embedded-Linux pattern:
  **the base OS image never gets written to directly during normal operation** - all runtime
  changes land in the overlay, and `/usr/data` (the big partition) is separate again. This means
  many kinds of experimentation are recoverable by design, not just by luck.

## 3. The official Ingenic documentation already in `docs hw/` - previously unreviewed

Two key resources sitting in `~/Documents/guppyscreen/docs hw/`, not looked at until this pass:

- **`02-Halley5_Linux4.4内核开发手册.pdf`** ("Halley5 Linux 4.4 Kernel Development Manual", Ingenic
  Semiconductor, v2.0, 2021) - 189 pages, **real, detailed, engineering-grade vendor documentation**
  for the exact kernel generation this device runs (`vermagic=4.4.94`) on the exact reference board
  family (Halley5, X2000). Confirmed by reading it directly (not just skimming):
  - Real kernel defconfig list including `halley5_v20_linux_msc_defconfig` (eMMC/SD boot - matches
    this device exactly) and, importantly, **`halley5_v20_linux_sfc_nand_recovery_defconfig`
    ("used for OTA-upgrade recovery config")** - recovery is a standard, designed-in part of this
    platform, not something uniquely locked down by Creality. A reference partition table example
    in the same manual includes an explicit `recovery` partition alongside `xboot`/`boot`/
    `pretest`/`reserved`.
  - Concrete, actionable instructions for modifying and reflashing the device tree (`make
    kernel-dtbs`, exact output paths, exact Kconfig symbol `INGENIC_BUILTIN_DTB`, exact flash
    offsets for eMMC: dtb at `0xb00000`).
  - A full chapter (28) on the SoC's built-in Gigabit Ethernet MAC (GMAC/RGMII) - not directly
    usable without hardware (the Nebula Pad doesn't appear to have a populated ethernet PHY), but
    confirms the SoC itself has real wired-ethernet silicon.
  - Kconfig-level detail for the USB host/device stack (exact symbol names, e.g. `VFAT_FS`,
    default USB host support = mass storage/camera/HID only - **matches exactly what we found live
    on the device this session**, strong evidence this manual really does describe this device's
    actual configuration, not just a generic relative).
  - Confirms the rootfs build system is **Buildroot** (`buildroot/dl/...`,
    `buildroot/package/ingenic/...` paths throughout) - matches §1's live confirmation exactly.
- **`X2000_PM_20220909.pdf`** - the X2000 chip Programming Manual (43MB, official chip-level
  reference) - not yet reviewed in depth this session, real next step (register-level detail,
  likely including boot-mode/strap-pin selection, useful for understanding recovery-mode entry).
- **`ingenic-linux-docs-ingenic-master/`** - a full clone of Ingenic's public docs repo, mostly
  covering their *newer* kernel-5.10-based SDKs (X2000/X1600/X2500/X26XX). One concrete, valuable
  find inside it: a kernel-5.10 X2000 SDK release note documents a **public FTP server with public
  credentials** for their official flashing tool:
  ```
  ftp://ftp.ingenic.com.cn/DevSupport/Tools/USBBurner/cloner-2.5.54-{ubuntu,windows}_alpha.tar.gz
  account: ingenic_public   password: BFdg2f9B12
  ```
  Real, vendor-published, explicitly public credentials (not a leak) - genuine evidence the tooling
  ecosystem for this chip family is realistically obtainable, not something to reverse-engineer
  blind. Also documents the exact cross-compiler used (`gcc 7.2.0, Ingenic MIPS LINUX Tools
  R5.2.2`) for the newer SDK generation - useful reference even though our device is on the older
  Linux-4.4-based Halley5 SDK, not this one.

**Update - this question is now answered, see §5a below.** The kernel source itself (not just the
manual) turned out to be publicly obtainable, exact-version-matching, and is now cloned locally.

## 4a. Phase 0 results (2026-07-18) - the kernel source match, found and cloned

GitHub code search for the exact strings found live on this device (`x2000_module_base`,
`halley5_v20`) turned up two public repos carrying a full Ingenic X2000/Halley5 kernel tree:
[`Jubian540/x2000_kernel`](https://github.com/Jubian540/x2000_kernel) and
[`bakueikozo/atomkernel4`](https://github.com/bakueikozo/atomkernel4), plus a matching Buildroot
config: [`lone0/buildroot-x2000`](https://github.com/lone0/buildroot-x2000) ("Buildroot for
Halley5, the evaluation board for Ingenic X2000 SoC"). All shallow-cloned into this workspace's new
`vendor/` directory (`vendor/x2000_kernel`, `vendor/buildroot-x2000` - gitignored-worthy, large,
not meant to be committed wholesale; see note at the end of this section).

Confirmed, not assumed:

- **Exact kernel version match**: `vendor/x2000_kernel/Makefile` -> `VERSION = 4, PATCHLEVEL = 4,
  SUBLEVEL = 94` - this is genuinely `4.4.94`, byte-identical to this device's own
  `vermagic=4.4.94` extracted back in `NETWORKING.md` §2. Not "close enough" - exact.
  Codename: "Blurry Fish Butt" (the real, if silly, upstream 4.4 release codename).
  - **This is a real find - but likely not, or not purely, a redistributable one.** No provenance
    is documented in either repo (no README noting how it was obtained); given the file layout
    (full stock Linux tree plus vendor board files, no visible license/attribution changes) this
    reads as a reupload of an internal Ingenic SDK drop, the kind that circulates through Chinese
    hardware-hacking channels (a pattern one of these accounts explicitly names elsewhere: "reupload
    from gittea/baidu cloud" on a related repo). The kernel itself is GPLv2 (inherently
    redistributable, and Ingenic's own patches on top inherit that), but treat this as an unofficial
    community mirror, not an Ingenic-sanctioned release - keep it local/reference-only for now,
    don't publish or redistribute further without thinking about it properly first.
- **Board files match exactly**: `arch/mips/boot/dts/ingenic/x2000_module_base.dts`,
  `x2000_module_base_mmc0.dts`, `x2000_module_base_mmc2.dts` (matching this device's live
  `/proc/device-tree/compatible` = `ingenic,x2000_module_base` exactly) and
  `arch/mips/configs/halley5_v20_linux_msc_defconfig` /
  `halley5_v20_linux_sfc_nand_recovery_defconfig` (matching the kernel manual's defconfig table
  exactly, §3 above) both exist in this tree.
- **The AX88179 driver (the whole point of track 2) is already in this exact source tree**:
  `drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.c`, `usbnet.c`, `asix_common.c`, `asix_devices.c` all present.
  Confirmed **not enabled** in the closest-matching defconfig
  (`x2000_module_base_linux_mmc2_defconfig`: `# CONFIG_USB_USBNET is not set`). Exact Kconfig
  symbol confirmed from `drivers/net/usb/Kconfig`: **`CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A`** ("ASIX
  AX88179/178A USB 3.0/2.0 to Gigabit Ethernet" - literally names our exact adapter). This turns
  track 2 from "build a driver against a hoped-for-compatible source" into "flip a defconfig option
  and rebuild" - about as tractable as this kind of problem gets.
- **`lone0/buildroot-x2000` has a real `board/halley5/` directory and `configs/halley5_x2000_defconfig`**
  - a genuine, matching Buildroot config for this exact reference board (though it targets a plain
  rootfs, not squashfs+overlay - `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_SQUASHFS` is unset there, so Creality's
  read-only-squashfs-plus-overlay scheme, §2, is their own customization on top of the vendor
  reference, not something this base config already does).
- **Live device tree spot-check**: `/proc/device-tree/` on the real printer lists real, plausible
  Ingenic X2000 nodes (`ahb0`/`ahb1`/`ahb2`, `apb`, `cpufreq-dt`, `interrupt-controller`,
  `reserved-memory`, `rtcclk`, `spi_gpio`) - consistent with a real X2000 device tree, not yet
  diffed node-by-node against the reference `.dts` (real remaining task, not done this pass).

**What this changes**: Phase 0's single biggest open question (matching kernel source) is answered.
Phase 1 (build the AX88179 module, test via `insmod`) is now realistic to actually attempt, not
just plan - the source, the exact symbol, and the exact vermagic target are all in hand.

## 4b. Phase 0 results, continued - real GPT partition table + silicon-level recovery mode

Two more Phase 0 items done properly rather than inferred from sizes.

**GPT partition table, parsed byte-for-byte (read-only `dd` of the first 68 sectors of
`/dev/mmcblk0`, decoded locally with a small Python script against the real GPT spec - not
guessed from partition sizes alone as in §2):**

```
p1  ota           1 MiB     (OTA update state/metadata)
p2  sn_mac        1 MiB     (serial number / MAC provisioning data)
p3  rtos          4 MiB   \  real A/B pair - firmware for the X2000's auxiliary
p4  rtos2         4 MiB   /  XBurst0 real-time core (separate from the main Linux cores)
p5  kernel        8 MiB   \  real A/B pair - the Linux kernel image (uImage)
p6  kernel2       8 MiB   /
p7  rootfs        500 MiB \  real A/B pair - the squashfs root filesystem image
p8  rootfs2       500 MiB /
p9  rootfs_data   300 MiB    writable ext4 overlay (confirmed via mount, §2)
p10 userdata      6130 MiB   /usr/data (confirmed via mount, §2)
```

This is a **real, genuine A/B update-safety design** - not inferred, confirmed by name. Better
still, `/proc/cmdline` on the live device reads `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7` - **`p7`/`rootfs` is the
currently active slot, meaning `p8`/`rootfs2` (and very likely `p6`/`kernel2`) are spare, currently
unused partitions.** This is about as safe a concrete experimentation target as this device could
offer: a custom kernel/rootfs could go on the *B* slot entirely, with the *A* slot (currently
booting, working) completely untouched throughout Phase 1/2 testing.

**Silicon-level recovery mode - resolves the one risk flagged as unconfirmed in §2/§4:**
`X2000_PM_20220909.pdf` chapter 42 ("XBurst Boot ROM Specification") documents this precisely.
The X2000 has an internal 16KB mask ROM that always runs first after reset, before anything on
the eMMC is even read, and its behavior is selected by three physical strap pins:

```
BOOT_SEL0 = pin PE25, BOOT_SEL1 = pin PE26, BOOT_SEL2 = pin PE27

boot_sel[2:0]   Boot source
000             SPI flash @ 3.3V
001             eMMC/SD (MSC2 @ 3.3V)
010 or 110      USB (recovery/download mode)
011             NOR flash
100             SPI flash @ 1.8V
101             eMMC/SD (MSC0)
111             eMMC/SD (MSC2 @ 1.8V)
```

With `boot_sel[2:0]` strapped to `010`/`110`, **the mask ROM itself switches to USB download mode
and waits for a host PC** - a documented, complete protocol (USB VID:PID `0xa108:0xEAEF` - `0xa108`
is Ingenic's own vendor ID, which not coincidentally also shows up elsewhere on this exact board's
`lsusb` output already, `NETWORKING.md` §1 context), 6 vendor control requests
(`VR_GET_CPU_INFO`/`VR_SET_DATA_ADDRESS`/`VR_SET_DATA_LENGTH`/`VR_FLUSH_CACHES`/
`VR_PROGRAM_START1`/`VR_PROGRAM_START2`), used to load a small SPL program into internal SRAM and
run it. **This recovery path lives entirely in mask ROM - it cannot be bricked by any software
mistake, corrupted bootloader, or bad flash write, because it runs before any of that is ever
read.** This is the best possible category of recovery mechanism, and it's exactly what the
"cloner" flashing tool (`NETWORKING.md`/`FIRMWARE.md` §3) talks to.

**One real unknown left, and it's a hardware question, not a software one**: whether `PE25`/`PE26`/
`PE27` are actually broken out to an accessible pad/test-point/jumper on the Nebula Pad's specific
PCB, or whether reaching them would need probing the chip package directly. Not answerable via SSH
- would need physical inspection of the board (or Creality/community teardown photos) whenever a
real flash is actually attempted. Everything else about the recovery path is now fully documented
and doesn't need further investigation.

## 4. Revised difficulty assessment

This materially changes the earlier (`NETWORKING.md` §6) assessment - not because the work
shrinks to zero, but because several previously-unknown risk factors are now resolved in our
favor:

- Recovery is a real, standard, vendor-designed feature of this exact platform (§3), not an
  unknown - meaningfully reduces "irrecoverable brick" risk for kernel/rootfs-level work.
- The rootfs build system is the one we'd have chosen anyway (Buildroot) and is already confirmed
  in use, not something to introduce fresh.
- We have genuine, detailed, engineering-grade vendor documentation for the exact kernel
  generation and reference board family this device is built from - not a generic "some MIPS SoC"
  situation, a specific, well-documented one.
- The base OS image is read-only with an overlay (§2) - normal experimentation is naturally
  contained.

What's still genuinely hard: doing real board-level kernel *work* (not just adding a module) means
working carefully through 189 pages of real, detailed vendor documentation plus whatever
Creality-specific customization exists on top of the Halley5 reference (touch controller specifics,
the exact WiFi/BT combo chip integration, camera driver specifics) - real work, just no longer
*blind* work, and no longer blocked on "do we even have matching source" (§4a - resolved).

## 5. Gameplan (Phase 0 essentially complete - rest pending explicit go-ahead)

**Phase 0 - research/acquisition, zero device risk (all local/network, not touching the printer)**
1. ~~Try to obtain the actual Halley5 Linux-4.4 kernel source tree~~ **DONE (§4a)** - found and
   cloned locally (`vendor/x2000_kernel`, `vendor/buildroot-x2000`), exact version match confirmed.
2. ~~Review `X2000_PM_20220909.pdf` for boot-mode/recovery-entry procedure~~ **DONE (§4b)** - full
   silicon-level USB recovery mode documented and understood. One remaining sub-item is a hardware
   question (are the strap pins physically accessible on this board), not answerable remotely.
3. ~~Map the exact partition table byte-for-byte~~ **DONE (§4b)** - real GPT parse, not inferred:
   confirmed genuine A/B redundancy (`kernel`/`kernel2`, `rootfs`/`rootfs2`) and confirmed via
   `/proc/cmdline` which slot is active (`p7`) vs. spare (`p8`). Live device tree top-level nodes
   spot-checked (§4a) and look plausible; a full node-by-node diff against the reference `.dts` is
   the one remaining minor Phase 0 item, low priority given everything else now confirmed.

**Phase 1 - smallest possible real test, still low risk (the ethernet driver, track 2)**
4. Build the `ax88179_178a` kernel *module* (not a full kernel) against `vendor/x2000_kernel`,
   using the `x2000_module_base_linux_mmc2_defconfig` as a base with
   `CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A=m` enabled, matching the exact vermagic already extracted
   (`NETWORKING.md` §2 - `4.4.94 SMP preempt mod_unload MIPS32_R2 32BIT`). Needs a matching MIPS
   cross-compiler (RosetteOS already has MIPS cross-compilation experience/tooling from other work -
   reuse rather than rebuild). Test via `insmod` on the real, idle printer - session-only, worst
   case is a hang + power cycle, no image changes (see `NETWORKING.md` §2 for why this specific
   test is low-risk). Real, concrete proof our source/toolchain match is correct before attempting
   anything bigger.

   **Build + vermagic verification DONE (2026-07-19). `insmod` test NOT done yet - resume here.**

   Toolchain: reused the same Docker image already proven for RosetteOS's own MIPS builds
   (`pellcorp/k1-bash-build@sha256:0b96d1d65175c5a2e3a83a64c3212d08dd774fef0900f991e0ebc570ba896c85`,
   see `~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/build-nginx-mipsel.sh`). It bundles Ingenic's own
   `mips-gcc720-glibc229` toolchain at `/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229/bin/` - confirmed via
   the compiler's version banner ("Ingenic Linux-Release5.0.2-Default(xburst2(fp64)+glibc2.29)") to
   be Ingenic's actual vendor toolchain for this exact chip family, not just "a MIPS toolchain that
   happens to work." Default container user (`developer`) can't `apt-get install`; use
   `docker run --user root`. `bc` isn't in the image by default and is required by
   `include/generated/timeconst.h` - install it inline (`apt-get install -y bc`) before building; a
   pre-existing, unrelated, non-fatal Kconfig bug in this vendor tree
   (`drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/Kconfig:29: error: recursive dependency detected!`) fires on every
   config step but `.config` is still written correctly regardless - ignore the noise.

   Exact commands, run inside the container with `vendor/x2000_kernel` mounted at `/src` and `cwd`
   there:
   ```sh
   export ARCH=mips
   export CROSS_COMPILE=mips-linux-gnu-
   export PATH=/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229/bin:$PATH
   apt-get install -y bc   # once per container invocation, needs --user root
   make x2000_module_base_linux_mmc2_defconfig
   ./scripts/config --module CONFIG_USB_USBNET
   ./scripts/config --module CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A
   ./scripts/config --module CONFIG_MII
   make olddefconfig
   make -j$(nproc) modules_prepare
   make -j$(nproc) M=drivers/net modules
   make -j$(nproc) M=drivers/net/usb modules
   ```
   Produces (among incidental siblings in the same directories, harmless/unused):
   `drivers/net/mii.ko`, `drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.ko`, `drivers/net/usb/usbnet.ko`,
   `drivers/net/usb/asix.ko`. Confirmed present in the generated `.config` before building: `SMP=y`,
   `PREEMPT=y`, `MODULE_UNLOAD=y`, `MODULES=y`, `LOCALVERSION=""`, no `MODVERSIONS` line - the exact
   components of the real device's vermagic. **Verified after build**: `strings <file>.ko | grep
   ^vermagic=` on all four `.ko` files each reads exactly
   `vermagic=4.4.94 SMP preempt mod_unload MIPS32_R2 32BIT` - byte-identical to the string extracted
   from the real device's own existing modules (`NETWORKING.md` §2). Since `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS` is
   off on the real device (confirmed same place), this coarse vermagic match is the only
   compatibility gate that matters - no per-symbol CRC check needed.

   Built `.ko` files copied to a stable, durable location (not just left inside the gitignored
   `vendor/` clone, which could be deleted/re-cloned):
   `~/Documents/ke-mainline-klipper/artifacts/ax88179-modules/` (`ax88179_178a.ko`, `usbnet.ko`,
   `mii.ko`, `asix.ko`).

   **Remaining step, next concrete action**: `scp` these four `.ko` files to the real printer,
   confirm it's idle via a *fresh* `print_stats` check (it was mid-print - `BUTTRESS BASE M10 (L)`,
   PETG - when last checked 2026-07-19; that check is now stale, re-check don't trust it), then
   `insmod mii.ko && insmod usbnet.ko && insmod asix.ko && insmod ax88179_178a.ko` (load order
   matters - dependencies first), and check `dmesg`/`ip link` for a new interface. If it works. add
   an init script matching Creality's own `/module_driver/*.sh` pattern for persistence (§5 step 4
   below covers this already). If `insmod` reports a version mismatch despite the matching
   vermagic string, the next thing to check would be per-symbol CRCs after all (re-verify the
   `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS`-off assumption against the built `.ko`'s own `Module.symvers` output - the
   `usb` subdirectory's build emitted a "Symbol version dump ./Module.symvers is missing" warning
   not seen on the first (`drivers/net`) build; not yet investigated, likely benign since modversions
   is off on the target too, but worth a first look if `insmod` unexpectedly fails).

**Phase 2 - real custom builds, moderate risk, only after Phase 1 succeeds**

5. ~~Build a custom Buildroot-based rootfs image~~ **BUILD DONE 2026-07-19, zero device writes,
   minimal-proof-of-pipeline scope by explicit user pre-approval (they were away and asked what
   was needed to finish this unattended).** Full account below - read this before redoing any of
   this work.
6. ~~Consider kernel changes beyond adding modules (e.g. a newer Ingenic-community kernel fork)~~ -
   turned out to be exactly what step 5 above used, not a separate later step - see below.

**Phase 3 - only if everything above is solid and validated, NOT started, real hardware**
7. A real flash of kernel+rootfs to the live printer, using the platform's own confirmed recovery
   path as a safety net, only after dry-running the process as many times as reasonably possible
   against non-production copies (e.g. test on the paired/backup partition slot if p3/p4 or
   p7/p8 really are A/B pairs, confirmed in Phase 0). **Deliberately not attempted, and should not
   be attempted without the user present** - real hardware, no safety net if something goes wrong
   mid-flash, same standing rule as everywhere else in this workspace.

**Explicitly not recommended, no real reason to do it here**: replacing the bootloader (`xboot`) -
no concrete benefit identified for this project, and it's the single highest-risk component to get
wrong regardless of how well-documented the recovery path turns out to be.

### Phase 2 results (2026-07-19) - real cross-compiled kernel + rootfs, zero device writes

**Scope, agreed with the user before they left for the afternoon** (they were unreachable
mid-session, same pattern as track 1's `klippy_extras/` work): a minimal proof-of-pipeline build -
confirm the Buildroot cross-compilation pipeline actually produces a working image at all, not
attempt full production parity (that's real, substantial future work - the exact package set to
match Klipper/Moonraker/nginx/camera/WiFi, and converting to squashfs+overlay to match the real
device's A/B partition format - neither started, see "What's still needed for parity" below).

**What was built**, using `vendor/buildroot-x2000`'s own `halley5_x2000_defconfig` as-is (the real
vendor-community config for this exact board, found in Phase 0) inside the same
`pellcorp/k1-bash-build` Docker container already proven for other MIPS builds in this workspace -
entirely local compute, the real printer was never touched:

- **A full Buildroot-internal cross-toolchain**, built from scratch (not reusing Ingenic's
  pre-built `mips-gcc720-glibc229` toolchain from Phase 1 - this defconfig is set up to build its
  own, `BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y`).
- **A real, working Linux kernel, version 6.1.28** - genuinely newer than the device's current
  4.4.94, which is actually the point ("more lightweight, more up to date" was the original ask).
  Source: [`Ingenic-community/linux`](https://github.com/Ingenic-community/linux) (real, active,
  33-star GitHub org "dedicated to unleashing the full potential of Ingenic processors", pushed as
  recently as 2025-03-27) at commit `39aefb83ed4422c63fa56e0d87b3e1317b6f60dc`, using its own
  `halley5` defconfig (confirmed `CONFIG_X2000_HALLEY5=y` - genuine, real X2000/Halley5 board
  support on a modern kernel, not a coincidence). **This is a different, separate kernel source
  from `vendor/x2000_kernel`** (the 4.4.94 tree Phase 1 used to vermagic-match the device's
  *current, running* kernel for a loadable module) - Buildroot fetched this one itself, fresh,
  during this build; don't confuse the two or assume they're interchangeable. Built output:
  `uImage` (U-Boot-wrapped, 3.9 MB).
- **A real, working root filesystem**, Buildroot 2023.11.1, `busybox`-based, ext2 format, 60 MB.
  Sanity-checked directly (via `debugfs`, no mount/root needed) - correct top-level layout
  (`/bin`, `/etc`, `/lib`, `/sbin`, `/usr`, `/var`, `linuxrc`), `/usr/lib/os-release` reads
  `NAME=Buildroot VERSION=2023.11.1` as expected, `/bin/busybox` present and correctly sized.
- **Zero build errors.** Both the kernel and rootfs stages completed cleanly on the first attempt
  that actually had its build dependencies installed (`python3`/`bc`/`cpio`/`rsync`/`unzip`/
  `bison`/`flex`/`libncurses5-dev`/`file`/`build-essential`/`libssl-dev` - none of these are in the
  base `k1-bash-build` image, install them with `apt-get` as `--user root` same as Phase 1 before
  running `make`; the very first attempt failed fast because a separate `--rm` container had
  installed them and then discarded them - packages don't persist across separate container runs
  even with the same image, only the bind-mounted source tree does).
- **Saved durably** (not just left in the gitignored `vendor/` clone) at
  `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/`: `uImage`, `rootfs.ext2`, and `buildroot.config` (the exact
  `.config` used, for reproducibility) - committed to this repo (no remote, so "committed" means
  durable-on-this-machine, same caveat as Phase 1's artifacts).

**QEMU boot-test attempted, as agreed bonus verification - expected negative result, not a bug.**
Checked prior art first (`pellcorp/k1-qemu`'s own readme: even the SimpleAF author only got "mixed
success" trying to boot a MIPS Ingenic-family kernel under QEMU, and built a separate x86_64
stand-in for fast userspace-only testing instead - real, documented precedent this wasn't
expected to just work). Ran `qemu-system-mipsel -M malta` (QEMU's generic MIPS reference board,
the only MIPS machine model QEMU actually implements - there is no X2000/Halley5 machine model
upstream, confirmed by checking) against the built `vmlinux`+`rootfs.ext2`, 30s timeout. **Zero
console output at all** - not even early boot messages - confirming the kernel's Ingenic X2000
board-init code doesn't do anything meaningful against the Malta board's completely different
memory-mapped peripheral layout (no GT-64120 north bridge, different UART/interrupt-controller
addresses). This is the expected outcome given no X2000 QEMU support exists, not a build defect -
the build itself (cross-compile + basic rootfs structure) is independently confirmed correct via
the `debugfs` inspection above. **Real-hardware boot-testing remains the only way to actually
verify this image runs** - not attempted, needs the user present (see Phase 3 above).

**What's still needed for parity with the real device** (none of this started, all real, scoped
future work, not urgent):
1. **Package selection** - this build only has Buildroot's own default minimal package set
   (`busybox`, `dbus`, base system). Getting anywhere near replacing the real device's software
   stack needs Klipper, Moonraker, nginx, the camera pipeline, and WiFi driver/firmware support
   added as real Buildroot package selections - a substantial, multi-session undertaking, not
   attempted here on purpose (out of scope for "minimal proof-of-pipeline").
2. **Filesystem format** - this build uses plain ext2, not squashfs+overlay. The real device's
   spare `rootfs2`/`kernel2` partitions (Phase 0, `/proc/cmdline` confirms `p7` active, `p8`
   spare) are sized/formatted to match the *current* squashfs image - a converted or reconfigured
   Buildroot output would be needed before this could even attempt to occupy that slot format-
   correctly. `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_SQUASHFS` is a real, available Buildroot option, just not enabled
   in the vendor community's own reference config (which targets a plain rootfs use case, not
   Creality's specific A/B+overlay scheme) - flipping it on is straightforward when this is picked
   back up, not a research question.
3. **Device-tree/driver fit** - this kernel's `halley5` defconfig is for the *reference* Halley5
   evaluation board, not Creality's own customized Nebula Pad variant. Whether it needs any
   device-tree changes for this board's specific touch controller, WiFi/BT combo chip, or camera
   wiring is unconfirmed - likely some, unknown how much, not investigated this pass.
4. **Real hardware boot test** - the actual, only real verification that any of this works, per
   above. Needs the user present.

Nothing above has touched, flashed, or written to the real printer. This is a plan and a real,
verified-as-far-as-possible-without-hardware build artifact to pick up in a later session, one
step at a time, with the user's explicit go-ahead before any step that touches the real device
beyond read-only queries - fully consistent with how every other risky-adjacent step in this
workspace has been handled so far.

## 6. Live comparison against the real printer (2026-07-19) - what parity actually needs, reframed around "as open as possible"

**New framing from the user, stated explicitly this session**: the goal of this whole workspace is
"a complete 'open' printer, as much as possible" - not just a working replacement, a *more open*
one where feasible. This matters concretely: several places below where the real device uses
Creality's own closed/out-of-tree driver, this kernel's fork already has a real, fully open
mainline equivalent - meaning the honest goal isn't just "match parity" but "match or improve on
openness," and this section reflects that framing throughout.

User turned the printer on specifically so this comparison could be done for real instead of from
memory/assumption. All of the following is read-only (`ssh`, `lsmod`, `dmesg`, `i2cdetect`, no
writes) against the live device, cross-checked directly against the actual kernel source tree this
workspace already has (`vendor/buildroot-x2000/output/build/linux-<sha>/`, the same 6.1.28
Ingenic-community tree Phase 2 built).

**The real device's 14 custom kernel modules, confirmed exactly** (`lsmod` + `/module_driver/`
listing, matches the "14 modules" figure already in this file from earlier forensics):
`soc_watchdog`, `soc_efuse`, `ns2009_touch`, `lcd_general_480x272`, `hci_uart_h5_kernel_4_4_94`,
`cywdhd`, `soc_dtrng`, `soc_msc`, `soc_fb`, `soc_fb_layer_mixer`, `soc_rotator`, `pwm_backlight`,
`soc_pwm`, `soc_gpio`, `soc_i2c`, `soc_utils`, `rmem_manager`, `utils` (18 module names in `lsmod`
- some inter-depend, `utils`/`soc_utils` are shared low-level helpers most others link against).

### Per-peripheral assessment

**Camera - LOW risk, and can end up *more* open than stock, not just at parity.** The real device's
camera path is UVC webcam (`CCX2F3298`, `/dev/video4`) into Creality's own closed `cam_app`, which
drives Ingenic's proprietary "Helix"/"Felix" V4L2 M2M hardware H.264/JPEG encoder
(`vpu-helix`/`vpu-felix`, built into the kernel, not a loadable module, no public source). **The
user pointed at the actual fix**: `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer` (a real GPLv3-licensed port of the
open-source µStreamer project - corrected 2026-07-26, this entry originally, incorrectly, called it
MIT; the vendored `LICENSE` file is the full GPLv3 text) + `pellcorp/creality`'s
`k1/services/S50webcam` init script - which
runs `ustreamer -c HW -m MJPEG -d $V4L_DEVICE` directly against the UVC webcam device node. `-c HW`
means the *webcam's own onboard ISP* does the MJPEG compression (standard behavior for basically
any USB UVC webcam) - this **never touches Ingenic's Helix encoder at all**, the exact same
approach every generic Voron/Klipper printer with a USB webcam already uses. This is a strictly
better position than "match Creality's closed pipeline": skip it entirely, use a fully open
component instead. What's actually needed: `CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS` (`uvcvideo`, stock mainline USB
video driver, confirmed present in this kernel's `Kconfig` - just currently disabled,
`CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT` is off in the current build) enabled and the kernel rebuilt, plus
cross-compiling `k1-ustreamer` for this target and adding the `S50webcam`-equivalent init script.
No device-tree work, no proprietary driver needed at all.

**WiFi - LOW-MEDIUM risk, and a real openness upgrade over stock.** Live device: `dmesg` confirms
the actual chip is a **Cypress CYW43438** (SDIO, vendor:device `02D0:A9A6`), loaded via Creality's
own closed `cywdhd.ko` (927 KB blob) plus a real firmware file already on the device,
`/lib/firmware/wifi_bcm/cyw43438-7.46.58.13.bin`. **CYW43438 is the exact same combo chip used on
the Raspberry Pi 3B and Pi Zero W** - one of the most mainline-supported WiFi chips that exists,
specifically *because* of Pi ubiquity. Confirmed directly: this exact kernel tree's `halley5`
defconfig **already has `CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=m` with SDIO support enabled** (the fully open, in-tree
mainline driver) - almost certainly because the reference Halley5 eval board itself also pairs
with a Broadcom/Cypress SDIO chip. Not yet confirmed byte-exact chip-ID match in
`brcmfmac`'s own `chip.c` tables (found `BRCM_CC_43430_CHIP_ID`/`CY_CC_43439_CHIP_ID` nearby but
not an exact `43438` literal in a quick grep - needs a closer check, not a blocker, very likely
fine given how well-trodden this exact chip is). The firmware blob itself would still be needed
(same as every Pi does) - the *driver* would be fully open, a real upgrade over Creality's closed
`cywdhd`.

**Bluetooth - LOW-MEDIUM risk, similarly upgradeable.** Live device: `BCM4343A1` combo silicon (same
package as the WiFi side), loaded via Creality's own `hci_uart_h5_kernel_4_4_94.ko` - literally
named for this exact kernel build, i.e. certainly won't load as-is on a 6.1 kernel regardless.
Real Broadcom patch-RAM firmware files already exist on the device in standard `.hcd` format
(`/lib/firmware/bt_bcm/BCM4343A1_*.hcd`) - this is the *same* file format mainline Linux's own
`hci_uart` H5 (three-wire UART) protocol support plus `btbcm`/`hci_bcm` firmware loading already
knows how to consume. Confirmed the H5 protocol option exists in this kernel's `Kconfig`
(`Bluetooth: Three-wire UART (H5) protocol support`); not yet enabled in the current build
(`CONFIG_BT_HCIUART` unset) - a real but straightforward config-and-rebuild task, not a research
gap, and the existing `.hcd` firmware files can likely be reused as-is.

**Touch panel - the one genuinely uncertain, real-work peripheral.** Live device: `ns2009_touch.ko`
against an I2C-attached NS2009 resistive touch controller (confirmed via `i2cdetect`/
`/sys/bus/i2c/devices/*/name` showing `ns2009` on the live device). Checked this kernel's
`drivers/input/touchscreen/` directory directly - **no `ns2009`-named driver exists**, mainline or
otherwise, in this source tree. The closest generic candidates (`ads7846.c`,
`resistive-adc-touch.c`) are for different chip protocols, not drop-in compatible. This is the one
piece that most likely needs either a real new driver written against the NS2009's own register
protocol, or porting/adapting Creality's existing `ns2009_touch.ko` source (only 8.5 KB - small,
plausibly tractable) to the newer kernel's driver model. Flagged clearly as real, unstarted work,
not a config flip.

**Display/LCD - genuinely uncertain, but the *available* option is architecturally better.** Live
device: Creality's own out-of-tree fbdev-style stack (`soc_fb` + `soc_fb_layer_mixer` +
`soc_rotator` + `lcd_general_480x272` + `pwm_backlight`/`soc_pwm` for backlight). This kernel tree
instead has a real, modern **DRM driver for Ingenic display hardware**
(`drivers/gpu/drm/ingenic/ingenic-drm-drv.c` + `ingenic-ipu.c`) - the architecturally-preferred,
actively-maintained-upstream approach vs. legacy fbdev, and genuinely more "open" in the sense of
being a real upstream-style driver rather than a vendor out-of-tree module. Currently disabled in
our build (`CONFIG_DRM` unset). **Unconfirmed**: whether this DRM driver's LCDC support covers the
exact small (480x272) panel/timing this specific board uses - that's real device-tree work, not
yet started, genuinely uncertain until tried.

**Core SoC infrastructure - likely LOW risk, probably mostly already solved by this newer kernel.**
The remaining custom modules (`soc_watchdog`, `soc_efuse`, `soc_dtrng`, `soc_msc`, `soc_gpio`,
`soc_i2c`, `soc_utils`/`utils`, `rmem_manager`) are Creality's own out-of-tree wrappers around core
SoC functions (RNG, MMC/SD host controller, pin control, I2C, reserved-memory/DMA management).
This kernel tree already has real, properly-in-tree equivalents for the X2000 specifically:
`drivers/char/hw_random/ingenic-rng.c`/`ingenic-trng.c`, `drivers/mmc/host/ingenic_mmc.c` +
`sdhci-ingenic.c`, `drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-ingenic.c`, `drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_ingenic.c`,
and more (`drivers/clk/ingenic`, `drivers/phy/ingenic`, `drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/
dwmac-ingenic.c`). Not individually build/boot-tested this pass, but the presence of a real,
apparently-complete driver set for this SoC family (rather than needing to port any of Creality's
14 custom modules directly) is a strong, concrete reason to expect this layer mostly "just works"
once the kernel config enables the right options - the actual open question is device-tree
correctness for this board's exact pin mapping, not driver existence.

**App stack and filesystem format - unchanged from Phase 2's own list, real substantial work,
untouched this pass**: Klipper/Moonraker/nginx/`k1-ustreamer`/GuppyScreen packaging, and converting
from plain ext2 to squashfs+overlay to match the real device's A/B partition format. Both still
completely unstarted.

### Net effect on the difficulty assessment

This live comparison is materially more encouraging than a generic "port 14 modules" framing would
suggest. Several pieces that looked like they'd need porting Creality's own closed drivers instead
have real, existing, fully-open mainline equivalents already sitting in the kernel source this
workspace is already using - WiFi (`brcmfmac`) and Bluetooth (`hci_uart` H5) most concretely, with
the existing firmware files on the device directly reusable in both cases; camera bypasses the
proprietary encoder entirely via the user's own `k1-ustreamer` suggestion. **Touch and display were
both looked at in much more depth in §7 below - the touch assessment above turned out too
pessimistic (a real open driver exists) and the display assessment above turned out based on a
wrong assumption (the DRM driver found here doesn't actually cover X2000 at all) - §7 supersedes
both bullet points for these two peripherals specifically, read that section, not this paragraph,
for the current state of either.** None of this has been attempted yet - this section (and §7) is
reconnaissance that makes the next real step (enabling configs, doing real backport/integration
work, and testing on real hardware with the user present) concrete rather than speculative.

## 7. Touch panel + display, looked at in depth (2026-07-19) - is either Creality-specific, or does an open equivalent exist?

User asked specifically, before starting work on either: is the touch driver and the display
driver genuinely Creality-specific, or is there an open-source equivalent already available? Real
answer for both, found by checking actual driver source (not just guessing from module names) -
**neither is a Creality-invented, un-reusable black box, but the two are in meaningfully different
states.**

### Touch panel (NS2009) - LOW risk, corrects §6's earlier "highest risk" call

§6 above concluded no NS2009 driver existed anywhere and this would likely need real new-driver
work. That was checked only against this workspace's own two kernel trees
(`vendor/x2000_kernel`, `vendor/buildroot-x2000`'s `Ingenic-community/linux`) - a broader GitHub
search turns up a different picture entirely:

- **NS2009 is a real, known chip** (vendor: Nsiway Technology, a genuine resistive touch
  controller IC), and **a complete, real, GPLv2 Linux driver for it already exists** - written by
  [Icenowy Zheng](https://github.com/icenowy) (a credible, real upstream Linux kernel contributor,
  well known for Allwinner SoC work), used across multiple independent embedded-Linux projects for
  the Allwinner V3S / Lichee Pi Zero / Lichee Pi Nano boards and derivatives (`suda-morris/SUDA_V3S`,
  `Dean-Chu/linux-v3s`, `EchoHeim/Allwinner-H616`, an OpenWrt sunxi patch series, and others - real,
  independent, working copies, not one-off toy code).
- **The driver (212 lines, `drivers/input/touchscreen/ns2009.c`) uses entirely generic Linux APIs**
  - `i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data`, the standard `input_dev`/`touchscreen_properties` framework,
  `input-polldev` for polling. Nothing Allwinner-specific in it at all - it only needs I2C + the
  input subsystem, both of which are architecture-agnostic. This means it's genuinely,
  straightforwardly portable to our Ingenic X2000 6.1 kernel: drop the file into
  `drivers/input/touchscreen/`, add a `Kconfig`/`Makefile` entry, add an I2C device-tree node
  matching what's already confirmed live on this printer (`i2cdetect`/`/sys/bus/i2c/devices/*/name`
  showing `ns2009` present, §6). Not yet merged into real upstream `torvalds/linux` (checked -
  zero hits), but real, working, and already proven across several other real SoCs.
- **Verdict: reuse this existing open driver.** This is integration work (get the file in, wire up
  Kconfig/Makefile/device-tree), not driver authorship. Corrects §6's "highest risk, real driver
  work" call to **LOW risk**.

**Update - actually done and build-verified (2026-07-19, same day), not just identified.** Ported
Icenowy Zheng's driver into `vendor/buildroot-x2000`'s 6.1.28 kernel tree and got a real,
correctly cross-compiled `.ko` out of it - zero device writes, pure local Docker cross-compile,
same toolchain Phase 2 already proved. Concretely, on top of the base patch:

1. Applied the driver + `Kconfig`/`Makefile` wiring cleanly (`patch -p1`, minor line-offset fuzz
   from the 5.4-to-6.1 version gap, no conflicts).
2. **Added a real `of_match_table`** (`compatible = "nsiway,ns2009"`) - the original patch only
   registered a legacy `i2c_device_id`, relying on i2c-core's older name-matching fallback; an
   explicit DT compatible string is the modern, more robust way to bind this on a real device-tree
   system.
3. **Ported the polling mechanism off `input_polldev`** - that whole framework (`devm_input_allocate_polled_device`/`input_register_polled_device`) was removed from mainline
   Linux between 5.4 (when this driver was written) and our 6.1 target; discovered this the honest
   way, via a real compile error (`fatal error: linux/input-polldev.h: No such file or directory`),
   not by inspection alone. Rewrote to the real modern replacement API
   (`input_setup_polling()`/`input_set_poll_interval()` on a plain `devm_input_allocate_device()`
   device), following the exact pattern this kernel's own `tps6507x-ts.c` driver already uses for
   the same kind of simple periodic-poll touchscreen.
4. **Added the missing `MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")`/`MODULE_AUTHOR`/`MODULE_DESCRIPTION`** - the original
   patch never had one at all (confirmed by grep - genuinely absent, not just unfamiliar
   convention), which `modpost` correctly refused to link without.
5. Hit and fixed two purely environmental build issues along the way, neither specific to this
   driver: `objtool` needing `libelf-dev`/`libelf1` (a host build dependency, not previously needed
   because the earlier Phase 1/2 builds happened to not exercise that code path), and one
   incremental-build invocation accidentally compiling for the host x86_64 instead of MIPS because
   `ARCH`/`CROSS_COMPILE` weren't re-exported in that particular `docker run` (container env vars
   don't persist between separate invocations, same class of gotcha as the missing-apt-packages
   issue Phase 1 already documented) - fixed by driving the rebuild through Buildroot's own
   `make linux-rebuild` (which supplies the correct, exact flags itself) rather than hand-invoking
   `make M=drivers/... modules` directly.

**Verified output**: `strings ns2009.ko` reads `vermagic=6.1.28 SMP preempt MIPS32_R1 32BIT`,
`license=GPL`, `name=ns2009`; `readelf -h` confirms a real MIPS object (`Machine: MIPS R3000`, the
standard ELF machine type for all MIPS variants). A separate, unrelated incremental-rebuild issue
(stale `vmlinux`-level SMP symbols - `ingenic_smp_init`/`jz4780_smp_wait_irqoff` - from mixing
build state across container instances) blocked linking a *complete* kernel image in the same
pass, but does not affect this module's own build correctness, confirmed independently via the
module's own successful `CC [M]`/`LD [M]` build steps and the vermagic/license/machine-type checks
above. A future clean one-shot rebuild (like Phase 2's original) would very likely not hit this.

**Independently double-checked one detail in this (2026-07-19, separate pass)**: the reported
vermagic says `MIPS32_R1`, worth verifying since this SoC is documented everywhere else as XBurst
II/MIPS32**R2**. Traced this to the actual kernel `.config` (not just the module) -
**`CONFIG_CPU_MIPS32_R1=y`** is genuinely what Phase 2's kernel build used, inherited as-is from
the `halley5_x2000_defconfig` community config. Compared directly against the real device: both
the vendor SDK's own matching defconfig (`vendor/x2000_kernel`'s `halley5_v20_linux_msc_defconfig`)
and the live printer's own currently-loaded modules (`strings /module_driver/*.ko`) confirm
`CONFIG_CPU_MIPS32_R2` is what this exact chip actually ships with. **Not a functional blocker** -
R1-compiled code runs correctly on R2-capable silicon (R2 is a superset), so this won't stop
anything from working - but it means this build isn't using the full instruction set the chip
actually supports. Worth flipping to `CONFIG_CPU_MIPS32_R2=y` in a future clean rebuild; flagged
now rather than left silently in.

**Saved durably** at `artifacts/ns2009-driver/`: `ns2009.c` (the final ported driver, all changes
above applied), `ns2009.ko` (the built module), `upstream-base-patch-lmahmutov-SGW-Openwrt.patch`
(the original 2017 patch this was based on, for provenance).

**Still needed before this is real on the actual printer** (none of this attempted - real hardware,
needs the user present): a device-tree node binding `compatible = "nsiway,ns2009"` at the confirmed
live I2C address (`i2c bus 4, address 0x48` - read via `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/4-0048/name` on the
live device, §6) with appropriate `touchscreen-*` properties (swapped-axes/inverted-axes/min-max,
following `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/touchscreen/touchscreen.yaml`'s standard
properties - this board's exact orientation/calibration not yet determined), and then a real
`insmod`+touch-event test on real hardware.

### Display/LCD - MEDIUM risk, corrects §6's overly-optimistic framing (the DRM driver found there doesn't actually cover this chip)

§6 above pointed at `drivers/gpu/drm/ingenic/` in the 6.1 `Ingenic-community/linux` tree as "a real,
modern DRM driver for Ingenic display hardware" and called this "architecturally better, just
unconfirmed for this exact panel." **That undersold a real gap, found on closer inspection**:
checking `ingenic-drm-drv.c`'s actual supported-SoC table shows it only covers the **older JZ47xx
generation** - `jz4740`, `jz4725b`, `jz4760`/`jz4760b`, `jz4770`, `jz4780`. **X2000 (XBurst II) is
not in this driver's supported chip list at all.** Confirmed further: the X2000 SoC-level device
tree in this same 6.1 kernel tree (`arch/mips/boot/dts/ingenic/x2000.dtsi`) has **zero**
LCD/panel/display-controller node of any kind, and the `halley5` defconfig this workspace has been
building against has no `CONFIG_FB`/`CONFIG_DRM` lines at all. **This specific community kernel
fork genuinely has no X2000 display support whatsoever** - not disabled, not "needs a device-tree
tweak," absent.

**User pushed back on this ("sounds implausible, did you search online?") - fair, and correct: the
check above was GitHub code search + two local kernel trees only, not a live web search. Redone
properly**: web search plus, most importantly, fetching the **actual current mainline
`torvalds/linux`** device-tree binding directly (not a fork, not a search-engine summary) -
`Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/ingenic,lcd.yaml`'s `compatible` enum lists exactly the
same 6 chips (`jz4740`/`jz4725b`/`jz4760`/`jz4760b`/`jz4770`/`jz4780`) and no X2000 entry, confirmed
by reading the real file content, not a summary of it. One search engine's AI-generated summary
claimed "X2000 LCD bindings exist in kernel.org documentation" - checked directly and that claim
was **not supported by the actual file** (a real example of why synthesized search summaries need
verifying against source, not trusting at face value). Web search separately confirmed X2000 itself
(core SoC bits - pinctrl, clocks) landed in mainline starting around Linux 5.10 (Phoronix), but
nothing turned up for X2000 *display* support anywhere, mainline or community. **Conclusion
unchanged, now confirmed from three independent sources** (this workspace's kernel tree, live
upstream kernel.org fetch, web search) rather than two local trees alone.

**The real, better path forward, found in the vendor SDK this workspace already has**
(`vendor/x2000_kernel`, the exact-kernel-version-matching 4.4.94 tree from Phase 0): real, complete,
**genuinely open-source (GPLv2, "Copyright (c) 2012 Ingenic Semiconductor Co., Ltd.", confirmed by
reading the actual file header) X2000 display driver source exists** -
`drivers/video/fbdev/ingenic/fb_v12/ingenicfb.c` (whose own top-of-file path comment literally
reads `drivers/video/fbdev/ingenic/x2000_v12/ingenicfb.c` - confirming this is specifically the
X2000-generation version of Ingenic's fbdev driver, not a generic/unrelated one), enabled via
`CONFIG_FB_INGENIC=y`. **Confirmed this is exactly the config already proven to match this real
device**: `halley5_v20_linux_msc_defconfig` (the same defconfig Phase 0 already confirmed matches
this printer's kernel manual/build) has `CONFIG_FB_INGENIC=y` and a full display config block (11
lines: `CONFIG_FB`, `CONFIG_FB_CFB_*`, `CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_*`, `CONFIG_LCD_CLASS_DEVICE`, etc.) - this
driver is real, working, vendor-shipped, on this exact hardware family, not experimental. The
`fb_v12/displays/` directory (checked in §6) holds real example panel definitions
(`panel-kd035hvfbd037.c` and others) following a small, consistent pattern - strong evidence
Creality's own `lcd_general_480x272.ko` is nothing more than one more panel definition in this same
family, built on Ingenic's real open framework, not a from-scratch closed thing of their own.
`x2000_fullcolor_24inch_linux_sfc_nand_defconfig` and `x2000_fullcolor_7inch_linux_sfc_nand_defconfig`
(other real defconfigs in this same vendor tree) confirm this driver family is used with multiple
real panel sizes in production Ingenic reference designs, not a one-off.

**Verdict at the time: real work, but a well-understood category of it** - backport Ingenic's real
GPLv2 `CONFIG_FB_INGENIC` driver from the 4.4.94 vendor tree forward to the 6.1 kernel, a real but
well-trodden "port across a version gap" task. **Superseded below - a much better base exists.**

### Update (2026-07-19, same day): user found a complete, newer (6.6) X2000 SDK with native display support - verified directly, real, changes the plan

User found and verified (not just described - actually read the source) a public mirror of a much
newer, more complete Ingenic X2000 SDK:
[`Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`](https://github.com/Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221).
Independently re-verified every claim directly against the actual repo (not taking the write-up on
faith) - all confirmed real:

- **Real repo** (`reupload from gittea/baidu cloud` - same honest provenance pattern already
  documented for `Jubian540/x2000_kernel` and friends, not a red flag, just how these vendor SDK
  drops circulate), 684 MB, pushed 2025-12-21.
- **A genuinely complete SDK in one place** - top level has `kernel/`, `buildroot/`, `u-boot/`,
  `device/`, `packages/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `external/`, `frameworks/`, `prebuilts/` - unlike our
  current setup (`vendor/x2000_kernel` + `vendor/buildroot-x2000` as two separately-sourced,
  separately-matched repos), this is one coherent vendor drop.
- **Real, complete, GPLv2 X2000 display driver, confirmed by reading the actual file**:
  `kernel/kernel-6.6/module_drivers/drivers/video/fbdev/ingenic/fb_stage/ingenicfb.c` -
  `Copyright (c) 2020 Ingenic Semiconductor Co., Ltd.`, `MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")`, registers via
  `of_device_id ingenicfb_of_match[] = { { .compatible = "ingenic,dpu" } }` - **not**
  `ingenic,x2000-lcd` as might be guessed (this is exactly why earlier compatible-string-based
  searches for this driver came up empty - the real string is generic across the whole "DPU"
  display-controller family, not X2000-specific naming). Kconfig symbol `FB_INGENIC_STAGE`
  ("Version 12 DPU SoC" - same "v12" driver lineage already found in the 4.4.94 tree, now carried
  forward to a modern kernel).
- **Real X2000 device-tree node, confirmed by reading `kernel/kernel-6.6/module_drivers/dts/x2000/x2000.dtsi`**:
  `dpu: dpu@13050000 { compatible = "ingenic,dpu"; reg = <0x13050000 0x10000>; interrupts =
  <IRQ_LCD>, <IRQ_MIPI_DSI>; dsi-host-reg = <0x10075000>; dsi-phy-reg = <0x10077000>; ... }` - real
  hardware addresses for this exact SoC's display controller and MIPI-DSI host/PHY blocks.
- **Real panel driver library** at `.../ingenic/displays/` - dozens of real `panel-*.c` files.
  Most (`panel-jd9365*.c`, `panel-st7701s*.c`, etc.) are MIPI-DSI panel-controller-chip drivers,
  but several (`panel-kd035hvfbd037.c`, `panel-kd050hdfia019.c`/`020.c`, etc.) are the same simple
  parallel-RGB-style panel entries already seen in the older 4.4.94 tree - `panel-kd035hvfbd037.c`
  specifically appears in **both** trees, confirming real continuity/lineage, not a different
  unrelated driver family. This board's actual 480x272 panel is almost certainly this simpler
  parallel/RGB style (cheap small printer displays essentially never use MIPI-DSI), not one of the
  MIPI examples - so the relevant reference pattern is the simple panel files, not the MIPI-DSI
  subsystem (`jz_mipi_dsi/`) also present in this tree.
- **Real Halley5-specific panel device-tree examples exist**: `HALLEY5_MIPI_LCD_FW050.dtsi`,
  `HALLEY5_MIPI_LCD_ZC50289HSHD02.dtsi` (both MIPI panels, not this board's exact 480x272 panel,
  but real proof this exact SDK has been used with real Halley5-family hardware).
- **Also has real `brcmfmac` (WiFi) driver source present** at the same path structure already
  used successfully in Phase 2 - this SDK isn't just "the display piece," it looks like a complete,
  internally-consistent replacement for the display-less 6.1 base Phase 2 built against.

**Why this wasn't found earlier**: the compatible string (`ingenic,dpu`) is generic across the
whole Ingenic DPU-family display controller line, not X2000-specific - none of the earlier
searches (which reasonably guessed at `ingenic,x2000-lcd`-style naming) would have surfaced it.
The directory is also named `fb_stage` now, not `x2000_v12` as in the older tree, another reason
straightforward name-based searching missed it initially.

**This changes the plan materially.** Instead of backporting a driver across a ~7-year kernel gap
(4.4.94 to 6.1, real, error-prone work spanning many API generations), the real options now are:
1. **Port just the display driver from this 6.6 tree into the existing 6.1 tree** Phase 2 already
   built against - a 5-minor-version gap instead of a ~20-version one, far more tractable.
2. **Rebase Phase 2 onto this newer, more complete 6.6 SDK entirely** - since it already has native
   X2000 display support plus WiFi, and is a single coherent SDK rather than two separately-sourced
   repos, this may be the better foundation going forward, not just for display. Real cost: some of
   Phase 2's already-completed build work (the `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/` kernel+rootfs)
   would need redoing against this new base, and the ported NS2009 touch driver (§7 above) would
   need re-verifying/re-building against it too.

**Decided: option 2 (rebase Phase 2 entirely onto the 6.6 SDK), by explicit user instruction.**
Done same day. Full account below.

## 8. Phase 2 rebase onto the 6.6 SDK - DONE (2026-07-19), zero device writes

Rebuilt Phase 2's kernel+rootfs from scratch against `Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`
instead of `Ingenic-community/linux`, using `vendor/buildroot-x2000`'s existing, already-proven
Buildroot pipeline (same Docker toolchain as before) - **not** the vendor's own elaborate
Android-style "lunch"/`envsetup.sh` build harness found alongside the kernel in that SDK (real,
complete, but a much larger, riskier surface to adopt whole-cloth than reusing our own
already-debugged pipeline just pointed at a different kernel source).

**Setup**:
- Sparse-cloned just `kernel/kernel-6.6` from the SDK (684 MB full repo; sparse checkout keeps
  this to ~1.8 GB working copy) into `vendor/x2000_kernel_6.6` (gitignored, same as other `vendor/`
  clones).
- Pointed Buildroot at this local source via its standard `<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR` mechanism
  (`local.mk` in `vendor/buildroot-x2000`, referenced by the already-present
  `BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE="$(CONFIG_DIR)/local.mk"`) - bypasses Buildroot's own download/git-
  clone step entirely via an rsync copy, the standard Buildroot way to build against a local
  source tree without wrapping it in a tarball or a nested git remote.
- Switched `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_DEFCONFIG` from the community fork's `"halley5"` to the real vendor
  SDK's own `"x2000_halley5_v30_linux"` (matching the real defconfig file,
  `arch/mips/configs/x2000_halley5_v30_linux_defconfig`, confirmed present in the cloned tree) -
  **already has `CONFIG_FB_INGENIC_STAGE=y` and `CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS=y`/`CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT=y`
  enabled by default**, i.e. display and camera support both come for free from this one defconfig
  switch, no manual config flipping needed for either.

**Three real, distinct build errors hit and fixed** (each genuinely new, not a repeat of Phase 2's
original gotchas):
1. **`linux-headers-custom` failed on a `binder.h` "leak" check** -
   `error: include/uapi/linux/android/binder.h: leak CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_64BIT to user-space`.
   This is a known, real quirk of this *exact* upstream Linux header (present in real
   `torvalds/linux` too, not something Ingenic introduced) when run through `make headers_install`
   outside a full kernel build context. Fixed by removing the 3-line
   `#ifndef CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_64BIT ... #endif` block from the local clone's copy of that
   header - we have no use for Android binder IPC on this device. Noted at
   `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/binder-h-fix-note.txt` for provenance.
2. **Kernel-headers version mismatch**: `Incorrect selection of kernel headers: expected 6.1.x, got
   6.6.x`. Root cause, found by tracing through Buildroot's own `linux-headers` package logic (not
   guessed): with `BR2_KERNEL_HEADERS_AS_KERNEL=y` selected, the *expected* headers version is
   derived from `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION` - which still held the old Ingenic-community git commit
   SHA from before the rebase (irrelevant to fetching once `OVERRIDE_SRCDIR` bypasses the download
   step, but still consulted for *this* label/consistency-check purpose). Two earlier attempts to
   fix this by hand-patching derived choice-group symbols
   (`BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_LINUX_HEADERS_CUSTOM_6_1` → `_6_6`) didn't work, because that whole choice
   group is unused in `AS_KERNEL` mode - a good reminder that hand-editing Kconfig-derived symbols
   in a raw `.config` is fragile; the robust fix was updating the one real source value
   (`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION="6.6.18"`) and letting `make olddefconfig` recompute everything
   dependent on it correctly.
3. **`bc: not found`** during an incremental (non-full-`make`) module build - same class of gotcha
   Phase 1 already documented (fresh `docker run` invocations start a package-less container; only
   the bind-mounted source tree persists across separate invocations, not `apt-get`-installed
   packages) - fixed by re-running the `apt-get install` step before the incremental build command.

**Build succeeded cleanly after these fixes.** Verified output:
- `uImage` (5.9 MB) and `rootfs.ext2` (60 MB), kernel release string `6.6.18-rt23`. **Correction
  (2026-07-30, production optimization mission)**: the `-rt23` release suffix reflects this SDK's
  source lineage only - it is NOT proof that `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT` is enabled. The claim below that
  this build is "a PREEMPT_RT real-time kernel variant... a welcome side effect of using this SDK's
  own default config" was never verified against the actual compiled config and is wrong: a direct
  `zcat /proc/config.gz` read of the real running kernel shows `CONFIG_PREEMPT=y` and
  `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT` **not set** (plain PREEMPT, not PREEMPT_RT). See §NEBULAOS_PRODUCTION_KERNEL_PREEMPTION
  near the end of this file for the full finding; PREEMPT_RT remains untested and is deferred to a
  separate, explicit A/B experiment.
- Kernel `.config` confirmed: `CONFIG_FB_INGENIC=y`, `CONFIG_FB_INGENIC_STAGE=y`,
  `CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS=y`, `CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT=y`, `CONFIG_CPU_MIPS32_R5=y` (this SDK's own
  choice, real and internally consistent - unlike the earlier 6.1 rebase's stray `MIPS32_R1` note,
  no mismatch flagged here; not independently cross-checked against real device precedent since
  this is a different, newer reference design (`v30`) than the device's own shipped `v20`/4.4.94
  kernel, so some real config differences between hardware revisions are expected and not
  necessarily a red flag).
- Rootfs sanity-checked via `debugfs` exactly as Phase 2's original build was: correct top-level
  layout, `os-release` reads `Buildroot 2023.11.1`, `/bin/busybox` present and correctly sized.
- Saved to `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/`: `uImage`, `rootfs.ext2`, `buildroot.config`,
  `kernel.config` (the actual kernel `.config` used, for reference), `local.mk` (the override
  mechanism, for reproducibility), `binder-h-fix-note.txt`. The original 6.1-based
  `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/` is **superseded but left in place**, not deleted - no reason
  to discard it, and it remains a real, valid build of a different (older) kernel lineage if ever
  useful for comparison.

### NS2009 touch driver re-ported against the new 6.6.18-rt23 kernel, same day

Reused the already-ported driver from the 6.1 rebase (§7's "Update - actually done" subsection)
rather than starting over - the driver itself (generic I2C + input-subsystem APIs) is
kernel-version-agnostic by design, but the *kernel's own API surface* had moved again in ways worth
finding and fixing properly rather than assuming compatibility:

1. **`i2c_driver.probe` signature changed** between 6.1 and 6.6: the old
   `int (*probe)(struct i2c_client *, const struct i2c_device_id *)` two-argument form (what the
   driver still used) is gone in this kernel's `include/linux/i2c.h` - only the newer
   `int (*probe)(struct i2c_client *client)` single-argument form remains. Found this by reading
   the actual header directly (not assuming it'd still compile), fixed by dropping the now-unused
   `const struct i2c_device_id *id` parameter from `ns2009_ts_probe()`'s signature - the function
   body never used `id` anyway.
2. **`CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN`'s own `menuconfig` gate wasn't enabled at all** in the
   `x2000_halley5_v30_linux_defconfig` - the entire touchscreen-driver subsystem is off by default
   in this reference config (plausibly because Ingenic's own reference board doesn't necessarily
   ship a resistive touch panel the way this printer does). Without this enabled first, the new
   `TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009` Kconfig entry has no menu to attach to and `make olddefconfig` silently
   drops it - not a bug, correct Kconfig dependency behavior, but a real thing to find and fix
   (`./scripts/config --enable CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN` before setting `TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009`).
3. Wired up `Kconfig`/`Makefile` entries in `drivers/input/touchscreen/` (new `config
   TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009` entry modeled on the neighboring `TOUCHSCREEN_TSC2007` entry;
   `obj-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009) += ns2009.o` in the `Makefile`) in the local
   `vendor/x2000_kernel_6.6` clone - real, durable changes to that local tree (not committed to the
   upstream repo, just how it's built here), same treatment as the `binder.h` fix above.

**Verified output**: `strings ns2009.ko` reads `vermagic=6.6.18-rt23 SMP preempt mod_unload
MIPS32_R5 32BIT`, `license=GPL`, `name=ns2009` - **vermagic's `MIPS32_R5` matches the kernel's own
`.config` exactly this time**, no repeat of the earlier 6.1 rebase's `R1`-vs-`R2` mismatch. Real
device-tree alias confirmed present: `alias=of:N*T*Cnsiway,ns2009` - ready to bind against a real
`compatible = "nsiway,ns2009"` device-tree node. Saved (overwriting the 6.1-era copies, which are
superseded) at `artifacts/ns2009-driver/`: `ns2009.c` (final ported source, both this session's and
the earlier 6.1 rebase's fixes applied), `ns2009.ko` (built against 6.6.18-rt23 now).

**Still needed before any of this is real on hardware** (none attempted, real device, needs the
user present, same standing rule as everywhere else in this workspace):
1. A device-tree node (`compatible = "nsiway,ns2009"`) at the confirmed live I2C address (bus 4,
   address 0x48, §6/§7) with appropriate `touchscreen-*` properties - orientation/calibration for
   this specific board not yet determined.
2. WiFi (`brcmfmac`)/Bluetooth (`hci_uart` H5) config enabling - not done this pass, deferred (this
   session's scope was the display/touch rebase specifically); the `x2000_halley5_v30_linux_defconfig`
   didn't have these on by default the way the old 6.1 community fork's `halley5_x2000_defconfig`
   did, confirmed not yet re-checked against this new tree.
3. A real device-tree panel entry for this board's actual 480x272 parallel-RGB panel (§7's
   "displays" findings) - not started; the `HALLEY5_MIPI_LCD_*` examples in this SDK are for MIPI
   panels, not this board's likely simpler panel type.
4. Converting from plain ext2 to squashfs+overlay to match the real device's A/B partition format -
   not started, same gap Phase 2's original build had.
5. **The actual real-hardware boot test** - the only real verification any of this works. Not
   attempted, needs the user present.

## 9. Recovery/brick-risk investigation (2026-07-19) - the real safety net, confirmed from primary sources

User asked directly, before going any further: "shouldn't we build everything first? will we not
brick the pad?" - a fair question given how much build work had already happened without any real
device testing. Investigated properly rather than reassuring from memory: checked the *actual*
official Creality recovery documentation for this exact printer (not just the Phase 0 chip-level
research), and the real U-Boot source in the SDK already in hand.

### The real answer: yes, there's a documented, official, physical recovery path - confirmed by reading the actual PDF, not a search-engine summary

User pointed at two pages. The Creality-Helper-Script wiki's K1 recovery page fetched cleanly; the
official Creality KE-specific wiki page didn't render via `WebFetch` (JS-rendered page, only a
title came through) - but a web search surfaced the real, primary source: a PDF directly in
`CrealityOfficial/Ender-3_V3_KE_Annex` (`firmware recovery tool/Brick Rescue and Wire Brushing.pdf`).
**Downloaded and read that PDF directly** (not the search engine's synthesized text, which turned
out to blend details from the K1 page in a way worth not trusting at face value - the same
"verify the primary source" lesson from the `ingenic,lcd.yaml` incident earlier this session).

**Confirmed, from the actual official document**:
- **"Screen" = the Nebula Pad itself is what gets recovered** - the PDF's own photos show the
  literal "Creality Nebula Pad" (model `N-Pad01`) enclosure being opened via a "Base Shell Screw",
  confirming this recovery process targets exactly the X2000 SBC this whole track has been about,
  not a separate motion-control board.
- **Real physical "boot button" and "reset button" exist directly on the Nebula Pad's own PCB** -
  labeled in the PDF's own board photo, next to the MicroUSB port, 3D-printer port, Gsensor port,
  and WiFi antenna connector. **No soldering, no multimeter continuity tracing, no probing raw
  chip pins required** - this fully resolves Phase 0's one flagged unknown ("are the BOOT_SEL strap
  pins physically accessible on this board") in the best possible way: yes, via a documented button
  combo (hold both 3 seconds, release reset first then boot), not by chance-finding a test pad.
- **This is genuinely the same USB-download/mask-ROM recovery mode already researched in Phase 0** -
  confirmed by the PDF's own Device Manager screenshot showing "Ingenic USB BOOT DEVICE" (the exact
  driver name X2000's Boot ROM chapter already predicted), and the same "cloner" tool family already
  found (`cloner-2.5.18-windows_alpha` here vs. `2.5.54`/`2.5.36.1` found elsewhere - same lineage,
  different snapshots).
- **Official, ready-made recovery images exist and are Creality-published**: the PDF links
  `CrealityOfficial/Ender-3_V3_KE_Klipper` as the "Wire Brush Pack" download - real `.ingenic`
  firmware bundles, not something we'd have to construct ourselves. The recovery tool's own GUI
  (screenshotted in the PDF) shows five flashable components - `boot`/`uboot`/`rtos`/`kernel`/
  `rootfs` - reflashed together as one bundle, confirming a full known-good factory image can always
  be restored this way, independent of whatever state the spare partition experiments leave things
  in.

**Net effect on the actual risk picture**: this is a *materially* better answer than Phase 0's
original "recovery exists in theory, physical access unconfirmed." The escape hatch is real,
documented by Creality themselves for this exact product, requires no special tools beyond a
screwdriver/USB cable, and has ready-made factory images to restore from. This should be treated as
a real prerequisite to *confirm hands-on* (open the case, verify the buttons are exactly where the
photo shows, ideally have the `.ingenic` recovery package downloaded and the cloner tool ready
*before* ever attempting a custom boot test) rather than something to assume works from documentation
alone - but the documentation itself is about as strong as this kind of thing gets.

### The other half of the question - how does normal (non-recovery) A/B slot selection actually work - only partially resolved

Checked the U-Boot source in the same 6.6 SDK (`u-boot/board/ingenic/x2000_halley5/`) for the real
slot-selection logic. Found real board files (`board.c`, `partitions.tab`,
`partitions_mmc_ota.tab`), but **the reference `partitions_mmc_ota.tab` doesn't even show an A/B
pair** (`uboot`/`kernel`/`recovery`/`nv`/`resource`/`userdata`/`system`/`storage` - one `kernel`,
one `system`, no `kernel2`/`system2`) - confirming Creality's actual A/B scheme on the real device
is their own customization on top of this generic reference, not something directly visible in the
vendor U-Boot source as shipped.

**Checked the live device directly instead** (read-only, printer was mid-print throughout -
confirmed via a fresh `print_stats` check first, single small read, no interference): the real
`ota` partition (`mmcblk0p1`, 1 MiB) contains exactly 11 meaningful bytes - the plaintext string
`ota:kernel\n`, followed by all zeros. This is a real, minimal flag - but it doesn't look like a
full "which slot is active" pointer (no slot number/letter encoded), more likely a progress marker
for an in-flight OTA update process. The kernel's actual boot slot
(`root=/dev/mmcblk0p7 rootfstype=squashfs ro`, confirmed via `/proc/cmdline`) must be decided
*earlier*, most likely via U-Boot's own environment variables - not directly read this pass (no
`fw_printenv` on the device, and no separate U-Boot-env partition identified/read yet).

**Honest status**: the *recovery* half of the safety question is now very well-answered. The
*normal-operation A/B slot-selection* mechanism is still not fully pinned down - real, remaining,
low-priority research (not urgent, since the recovery path above is a strong enough safety net on
its own that not fully understanding the *normal* slot-switch mechanism doesn't block moving
forward carefully). If it matters later (e.g. to understand whether a failed boot on the spare slot
would automatically fall back to the working one, or would need the recovery process above), it's
worth reading U-Boot's actual boot script/environment more directly - via a real device
(`fw_printenv`-style env partition, if one exists) rather than guessing further from source alone.

## 10. "Build everything first" pass (2026-07-19) - real hardware wiring for touch, display, WiFi, Bluetooth, camera; all zero device writes

By explicit user instruction ("build first, it will minimize testing time"), given how solid the
recovery path in §9 turned out to be. This is the single densest build session in this track -
full account below, organized by subsystem, with every real bug hit along the way (there were
several genuinely new ones, distinct from earlier sessions' gotchas).

### Touch (NS2009) - device-tree wired in

Added a real I2C device-tree node in `module_drivers/dts/x2000/halley5_v30.dts` (the exact board
DTS this build compiles, confirmed via `DTC module_drivers/dts/x2000/halley5_v30.dtb` in the build
log and `CONFIG_DT_HALLEY5_V30=y`): `&i2c4 { status = "okay"; ns2009@48 { compatible =
"nsiway,ns2009"; reg = <0x48>; }; };`. The reference v30 board disables `i2c4` by default (only
`i2c3` is on) - the real printer's touch controller is confirmed live on bus 4
(`/sys/bus/i2c/devices/4-0048/name`), so this is a real, necessary board-specific override, not
optional.

### Display - a real, working (if best-effort) panel driver, not just an enabled Kconfig option

Wrote a genuinely new panel driver, `displays/panel-rosetteos-general-480x272.c`, registered via a new
`CONFIG_STAGE_ROSETTEOS_GENERAL_480X272` Kconfig entry (modeled on this SDK's own
`STAGE_ST7701S_RGB666` entry) and wired into the board DTS (`&dpu { status = "okay"; }` plus a
standalone `rosetteos_panel` platform-device node using `compatible = "rosetteos,general-480x272"`).

**Modeled on this SDK's own `panel-st7701s-rgb666.c`** (a real, complete `LCD_TYPE_TFT` example),
simplified down to just the three required `lcd_panel_ops` callbacks (`init`/`enable`/`disable`) -
a plain "general" RGB panel needs no command-interface init sequence the way that example's smart
controller chip does.

**Hit and fixed two real compile errors along the way, both API-version mismatches between the
reference example (evidently written against an older kernel) and this actual 6.6 tree**:
1. Copied `struct lcd_ops` (the generic Linux LCD-class `set_power`/`get_power` framework) where
   `struct lcd_panel.ops` actually expects `struct lcd_panel_ops` (`init`/`enable`/`disable`) -
   two genuinely different structs with similar names. Fixed by dropping the generic
   `lcd_device_register()` path entirely (not required for `ingenicfb_register_panel()` to work)
   and implementing the three real callbacks directly.
2. `of_get_named_gpio_flags()`/`enum of_gpio_flags`/`OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW` - all removed from this
   kernel's `include/linux/of_gpio.h` (only the flag-less 3-argument `of_get_named_gpio()`
   remains). Fixed by switching to the flag-less call and hardcoding active-high polarity in C
   (documented as a real, flagged assumption - easy to invert in this one file if wrong).

**Confirmed real, from the live device** (read-only SSH, printer mid-print throughout,
`/sys/module/lcd_general_480x272/parameters/`): `gpio_lcd_power_en=PC21`, `gpio_lcd_rst=PB16`,
mode `480x272p-60`. **Not confirmed, best-effort defaults, clearly flagged in the driver's own
header comment**: exact sync timing (no datasheet found for this specific panel - used a
widely-documented standard timing for this exact resolution class instead), GPIO active-high/low
polarity, and color depth/mode (RGB888 assumed). Wrong values here would show as a garbled/
miscolored/shifted picture, not a hardware risk - genuinely tunable after a real boot, not
something that needs to be perfect before ever trying.

### WiFi (brcmfmac) and Bluetooth (H5) - both real, both hit real Kconfig gates that needed fixing

Added real hardware wiring in the board DTS: a `wlan_pwrseq` (`compatible = "mmc-pwrseq-simple"`)
node referencing the same WL_REG_ON GPIO (`gpd 1`) the vendor's own inert `bcmdhd_wlan` node
already named, referenced from `&msc1` via `mmc-pwrseq = <&wlan_pwrseq>;`. The vendor's own
`bcmdhd_wlan` node is left in place, unused, in case that out-of-tree driver is ever reconsidered
instead of mainline `brcmfmac`.

**Real Kconfig fights, each with a genuine root cause found, not just repeated `scripts/config`
guessing**:
1. `CONFIG_BRCMFMAC` kept vanishing entirely after `make olddefconfig` (not even appearing as
   "not set"). Root cause: `CONFIG_WLAN_VENDOR_BROADCOM` (the parent gate, `default y`) wasn't
   actually resolving to `y` from the prior incremental state - explicitly enabling it first fixed
   this. (The Kconfig `source` chain itself turned out to be completely standard/unmodified -
   an earlier, wrong assumption that this SDK had disconnected `brcm80211` from the menu tree was
   corrected by actually reading `drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/Kconfig`, not just the top-level
   file.)
2. Used a non-existent symbol name, `CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_H5` - the real Kconfig name for the H5/
   three-wire protocol is `CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_3WIRE` ("H5" is the protocol's common name, not its
   Kconfig symbol).
3. **A real, unresolved protocol tension, left as-is rather than forced**: mainline's dedicated
   Broadcom firmware-loading support (`CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_BCM`, which auto-selects `BT_BCM`/
   `btbcm.c`) only works with the H4 protocol, not H5 - but the original device's own closed module
   was literally named `hci_uart_h5_kernel_4_4_94.ko`, strongly implying H5 is what this hardware
   actually needs. Enabled `BT_HCIUART_3WIRE` (H5) to match that precedent; `BT_BCM`'s automatic
   firmware-patch loading isn't wired in as a result. Real BT function may need additional
   userspace tooling (`btattach`/`hciattach`) to push the existing `.hcd` patch files over H5, or
   further kernel-side work - not resolved, flagged honestly rather than guessed.

### A real, structural Buildroot bug found and fixed: incremental `.config` edits were silently discarded

The most consequential bug this session, not specific to any one driver: after enabling WiFi/BT/
touch via direct `scripts/config`/`make olddefconfig` edits inside `output/build/linux-custom/`,
a full rebuild reported success, but **the resulting `rootfs.ext2` had none of the new `.ko` files**
- `output/target/lib/modules/` only had one unrelated stale module. Root cause: Buildroot's own
package dependency/stamp tracking watches the **override source directory**
(`LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR`), not the build directory - editing `.config` directly inside the build
dir is invisible to Buildroot's tracking, so a later full `make` silently skipped
`modules_install`/image-copy, reusing stale artifacts from the *previous* successful build.

**The correct, durable fix**: created a real Buildroot kernel config fragment file,
`board/halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`, referenced via `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES` -
the proper, persistent mechanism for exactly this ("extra config on top of the base defconfig"),
combined with `make linux-reconfigure` (which properly re-extracts from the override srcdir,
reapplies defconfig + fragment together, and forces a real rebuild+reinstall) instead of ad-hoc
`scripts/config` calls in the build directory. This is the same lesson the NS2009 6.6 port already
hit once (`make linux-rebuild` mentioned in that section) - worth remembering as a standing rule
for this whole workspace: **kernel config changes for this Phase 2 build must go through the
fragment file + `make linux-reconfigure`, never direct edits to `output/build/linux-custom/.config`**,
or they will silently vanish on the next full rebuild.

### Camera (ustreamer) - cross-compiled clean, real MIPS binary

Cross-compiled `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer` (a real port of the open-source µStreamer project, GPLv3-
licensed - corrected 2026-07-26, this entry originally, incorrectly, called it MIT) using its own
documented build process - `pellcorp/k1-camera-build` Docker image (a different, separate container
from this workspace's usual `k1-bash-build`, using its own bundled toolchain at the same path,
`/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229` - **this claim of using "the exact same toolchain" was wrong**:
that toolchain's glibc 2.29 is a genuinely different, ABI-incompatible build from this project's own
Buildroot-internal toolchain (glibc 2.38, MIPS_O32_FP64 ABI) - the resulting binary's dynamic-linker
request (`ld-linux-mipsn8.so.1`) never matched this rootfs's real interpreter (`ld.so.1`), so it could
never actually execute here. Not caught until 2026-07-26, the first time this project had a real UVC
webcam physically attached to test with - see that date's entry for the real fix: rebuilding this
exact same source with the Buildroot-internal toolchain instead, in
`04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh`.), `docker.sh all` (builds
`jpeg-9d`, `libevent`, `libmd`, `libbsd` as static dependencies, then `ustreamer` itself dynamically
linked against them). Verified real: `file` confirms a genuine MIPS32r2 ELF binary. This is the
`ustreamer -c HW -m MJPEG` approach from §6 - pulls MJPEG straight from the UVC webcam's own
hardware compression, never touching Ingenic's proprietary Helix encoder at all.

**Saved** at `artifacts/ustreamer/`: `ustreamer` (the binary) + `lib/` (the four shared libraries
it dynamically links against - `libjpeg.so.9`, `libevent-2.1.so.7` and its `_core`/`_extra`/
`_pthreads` variants, `libmd.so.0`, `libbsd.so.0`). **Not yet integrated into the Buildroot rootfs
image** - these libraries aren't currently part of the Buildroot package set, so the binary would
need either the libraries added as real Buildroot packages, or copied onto the target filesystem
directly alongside the binary (e.g. via a rootfs overlay) - real, small remaining integration work,
not started.

### What's saved, and what's still real, unstarted work

**Saved to `artifacts/`** (all committed, all built with zero real-device writes):
- `buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` - updated `uImage`/`rootfs.ext2` with all of the above baked in,
  plus `kernel.config`, `buildroot.config`, `halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`, `halley5_v30.dts`
  (the real board DTS with all our additions, for reference/reproducibility).
- `panel-driver/` - `panel-rosetteos-general-480x272.c` + the built `.ko`.
- `ustreamer/` - the cross-compiled binary + its shared library dependencies.
- `ns2009-driver/` - unchanged from the earlier session, still valid (this session didn't touch
  the touch *driver* itself, only its device-tree wiring).

**Real, unstarted work, in roughly the order it'd make sense to tackle**:
1. Get `ustreamer` + its shared libraries actually into the Buildroot rootfs (either as proper
   Buildroot packages, or a rootfs overlay), plus the `S50webcam`-style init script from §6.
2. Squashfs+overlay conversion, to match the real device's A/B partition format - still plain ext2.
3. The Klipper/Moonraker/nginx/GuppyScreen application stack - not started at all, the single
   largest remaining item.
4. **The actual real-hardware boot test** - still the only real verification any of this works.
   Genuinely more ready for this than any previous point in this track (touch, display, WiFi, BT,
   and camera all have real, built, wired-in code now, not just plans) - but still needs the user
   present, per the standing rule throughout this entire workspace.

## 11. Closing the two flagged §10 unknowns (2026-07-19, later still) - real disassembly for display timing, real driver code for Bluetooth firmware loading

User pushed on whether everything in §10 was "100% correct," specifically the two flagged weak
spots (display timing, BT H4/H5). Rather than reason further from memory, went back to real
sources for both - the live device (read-only, confirmed idle via a fresh `print_stats` check
first) and the actual kernel source - and closed both out with real changes, not just better
documentation of the uncertainty.

### Display timing - extracted from the real device's own closed driver via disassembly, not guessed

Host `objdump` has no MIPS backend at all (`can't disassemble for architecture UNKNOWN`) - reused
the `pellcorp/k1-bash-build` Docker image's own bundled toolchain
(`/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229/bin/mips-linux-gnu-objdump`) to actually disassemble the
live device's `lcd_general_480x272.ko` and `soc_fb.ko` (pulled via read-only `scp`, kept in the
session scratchpad only - proprietary Creality binaries, never committed to this repo).

**Real findings**: `xres=480`/`yres=272` live at struct offsets `+8`/`+12`, confirmed via
`jzfb_register_lcd`'s own range-check code (`(x-32) < 2016`) - matches the already-known live mode,
a good sanity check the offset tracking was right. More importantly: **six adjacent struct fields
(offsets 0x14/0x18/0x1c/0x20/0x24/0x28) all hold the literal value 20**, summed in two groups of
three in a pattern matching `htotal`/`vtotal` computation from margins+sync widths - strong,
disassembly-grounded evidence the real panel's left/right/upper/lower margins and hsync/vsync pulse
widths are uniformly **20**, not the asymmetric generic-reference guess this driver shipped with
before (margins=2, hsync=41, vsync=10). Field order among the six couldn't be pinned down without
the real header, but since all six are identical, that ambiguity doesn't matter for correctness.
`pixclock` isn't a static constant in the .ko at all - it's computed at registration time - so it
was derived the same way (`htotal(540) * vtotal(332) * refresh(60)` = 10753 in this driver's KHz
convention) rather than read as a fixed value. A physical-size field pair (53mm, 95mm) was also
found, closely matching (within 1mm) this driver's already-guessed 54x95mm - reassuring, left
unchanged. GPIO polarity and color depth/mode remain genuinely unconfirmed - the disassembly didn't
shed light on those, and both stay cosmetic-risk-only if wrong.

**`panel-rosetteos-general-480x272.c` updated** with these real values (both the vendor-tree copy and
`artifacts/panel-driver/`), rebuilt clean via `make linux-reconfigure`, and the full image chain
regenerated (`uImage` + `rootfs.ext2`) to actually bake the corrected module in - confirmed via
`debugfs`-extracting the module from the fresh `rootfs.ext2` and `sha256sum`-matching it against
the standalone build output.

**One real build-environment bug hit and fixed along the way**: a full `make` (needed to regenerate
`rootfs.ext2`, not just the kernel via `make linux-rebuild`) failed with
`glib-compile-schemas: error while loading shared libraries: libgio-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared
object file`. Root cause, confirmed via `readelf -d`: that host tool's `RUNPATH` is hardcoded to
`/src/output/host/lib` from whichever mount path built it originally - this session had been
mounting the repo at `/br` inside the container, not `/src`. Fixed by mounting at `/src` instead
(matching the baked-in path) rather than patching `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (which was tried first and
broke `fakeroot` instead - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` overrides are the wrong tool when the real issue is a
mismatched bind-mount path). **Any future full `make` in this pipeline should mount the
`buildroot-x2000` directory at `/src`, not `/br` or any other path**, or host tools built in a
mismatched-path container will fail the same way.

### Bluetooth H4/H5 - a real, new `h5_vnd` for Broadcom, following the pattern already in mainline

Checked the real board DTS to resolve the one genuinely open fork from §10: does this UART have
hardware flow control at all? **`halley5_v30.dts` wires UART3 (Bluetooth) to `uart3_pc`**
(`x2000-v12-pinctrl.dtsi`: `<&gpc 25 26>`, a 2-pin TX/RX-only group) - **not** `uart3_pd` (`<&gpd 0
3>`, the 4-pin group that would carry RTS/CTS). This board genuinely has no hardware flow control on
this UART, confirmed from the real vendor board file, not inferred. This settles it: H4 was never
actually viable here, and Creality's own H5 choice was the correct one for this hardware, not an
arbitrary pick.

Also confirmed via live-device forensics (read-only SSH, printer idle) that Creality's own stock
firmware doesn't use the kernel `hci_uart`/BlueZ path at all: `/etc/init.d/
S41bt_bsa_download_firmware` -> `/usr/bin/bt_enable_bsa.sh` runs Broadcom's own proprietary
userspace "BSA" stack (`bsa_server -d /dev/ttyS3 -p .../BCM4343A1_...hcd`) directly against the raw
UART, bypassing BlueZ entirely - and BT isn't even running on the idle stock device right now (no
`bsa_server` process, `hciconfig hci0` reports no such device). Decided **not** to copy that
approach (still a closed proprietary stack) - instead went for the real open fix.

**Checked `hci_h5.c` directly**: it already has a vendor-extension mechanism (`struct h5_vnd`,
`open`/`close`/`setup`/`suspend`/`resume` callbacks) used today only for Realtek (`rtl_vnd`) - no
Broadcom equivalent exists upstream. But `btbcm_initialize()`/`btbcm_finalize()` (`btbcm.c`) are
themselves transport-agnostic - they only exchange ordinary HCI commands through whatever
`hci_uart` protocol is active underneath, confirmed by reading `bcm_setup()` in `hci_bcm.c` (the
existing H4-only path), which calls the exact same two functions. **So the real gap was purely that
nobody had wired that call into `hci_h5.c`'s vendor-extension mechanism - not a transport-level
incompatibility.**

**Wrote a real `bcm_vnd` for `hci_h5.c`**, mirroring `rtl_vnd`'s structure exactly:
`h5_btbcm_setup()` calls `btbcm_initialize()`/`btbcm_finalize()`; `h5_btbcm_open()`/`_close()` mirror
`h5_btrtl_open()`/`_close()`'s reset-pulse pattern using the generic `enable-gpios` DT property
(confirmed via `h5_serdev_probe()` that this is optional - `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` on a NULL
GPIO is a documented safe no-op, so the code works fine even without a confirmed dedicated BT
enable/reset pin, which this session did not find - only the shared WiFi-side regulator/reset GPIO
in `wlan_pwrseq` is confirmed live). New Kconfig symbol `CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_BCM_H5` (selects
`BT_HCIUART_3WIRE` + `BT_BCM`, same pattern as `BT_HCIUART_RTL`), new `of_match_table` entry
(`compatible = "rosetteos,bcm4343x-bt"`), and a matching `bluetooth` child node added under `&uart3` in
`halley5_v30.dts` (no `enable-gpios` property - genuinely unconfirmed, left absent rather than
guessed).

**Built and verified real**: compiled clean via `make linux-reconfigure`, `btbcm.ko` pulled in
automatically as a separate module, and `depmod`'s own generated `modules.dep` confirms the real
dependency (`hci_uart.ko: btbcm.ko`) - proof the symbol linkage between our new code and
`btbcm_initialize()`/`btbcm_finalize()` resolved correctly. Both `hci_uart.ko` and `btbcm.ko`
confirmed present in the regenerated `rootfs.ext2` via `debugfs`. **Completely untested against
real hardware** - no MIPS/X2000 boot test has been possible in this workspace, same caveat as
everything else here. The actual behavior (does the real firmware-download handshake succeed over
H5 the way it does over H4) is genuinely unknown until a real boot test.

**Net effect**: both of the two flagged unknowns from §10 now have real, built, evidence-based (not
guessed) answers baked into the image - display timing is extracted from the real hardware's own
driver, and Bluetooth has a genuine, from-scratch open-source fix rather than a documented
limitation. Neither has been verified on real silicon yet - that remains the single biggest
remaining gap across this entire track.

## 12. Camera rootfs integration + a real Core SoC infra audit (2026-07-19, later still)

User asked to close out the two remaining "not yet done" items from the overview table: camera
integration and Core SoC infra verification.

### Camera - `ustreamer` now actually in the image, not just a saved artifact

Confirmed first that the kernel side was already solid: `CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT`,
`CONFIG_MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT`, `CONFIG_MEDIA_USB_SUPPORT`, `CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV`, and
`CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS` are all `=y` (built-in, not modules) in the current kernel `.config` -
`uvcvideo` needs nothing further.

Used Buildroot's `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` mechanism (simpler than writing a full custom package `.mk`
for a single prebuilt binary) - created `board/halley5-nebulaos-overlay/` with the `ustreamer` binary,
its 7 shared library dependencies (with real SONAME symlinks created for each, e.g.
`libjpeg.so.9 -> libjpeg.so.9.4.0` - confirmed the exact SONAMEs actually needed via `readelf -d
ustreamer | grep NEEDED`, not guessed), and a new `S50webcam` init script. Rather than guess the
real CLI flags, read `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer`'s own `options.c` source directly - confirmed real,
working flags: `--device`/`-d`, `--format`/`-m` (accepts literal `MJPEG`), `--encoder`/`-c` (accepts
literal `HW`, `CPU`, `M2M-VIDEO`, `M2M-IMAGE`), `--host`/`-s`, `--port`/`-p`. The init script assumes
`/dev/video0` (this build only enables `uvcvideo`, no competing internal M2M encoder `/dev/videoN`
nodes exist unlike the stock device's `/dev/video4`) - flagged as unconfirmed against real hardware
enumeration order.

Set `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY="board/halley5-nebulaos-overlay"` in the top-level Buildroot `.config` (this
one, unlike the kernel's own `output/build/linux-custom/.config`, is the real persistent
configuration file - editing it directly is correct, not the anti-pattern from §10's Buildroot
stamp-tracking bug). Rebuilt with a full `make`, confirmed via `debugfs` that `ustreamer`, all 7
libraries (symlinks included), and `S50webcam` all landed correctly in the fresh `rootfs.ext2`.

### Core SoC infra - the earlier "believed to just work" claim needed a real check, and turned up one real, fixed gap

Went back to verify the Kconfig symbol names actually referenced in §6/§9's "already has in-tree
X2000 drivers" claim - and found that claim used **stale symbol names for an unrelated older SoC
generation** (`jz4740_mmc`/`i2c-jz4780`/`dma-jz4780`, all belonging to the much older first-generation
JZ SoC family, not X2000/XBurst II at all). Checked the real X2000 SoC-level device tree
(`x2000.dtsi`) for the actual `compatible` strings this board uses, then traced each to its real
driver source and Kconfig symbol:

| Function | Real DT compatible | Real driver source | Real Kconfig symbol | Enabled in our `.config`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I2C | `ingenic,x2000-i2c` | `module_drivers/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ingenic.c` | `CONFIG_I2C_INGENIC` | **Yes** |
| MMC | `ingenic,sdhci` | `module_drivers/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-ingenic.c` | `CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_INGENIC` | **Yes** |
| DMA | `ingenic,x2000-pdma` | `module_drivers/drivers/dma/ingenic/ingenic_dma.c` | `CONFIG_INGENIC_PDMAC` | **Yes** |
| RNG/TRNG | `ingenic,dtrng` | `module_drivers/drivers/char/hw_random/ingenic-rng.c` | `CONFIG_INGENIC_HW_RANDOM` | **No - real gap, found and fixed** |

All four real drivers live under this SDK's own `module_drivers/` staging tree (same convention as
the display/camera drivers already worked with this session), not mainline `drivers/` - the earlier
claim wasn't wrong about "drivers exist," just imprecise about where and under what names. I2C/MMC/
DMA were already correctly enabled by the vendor's own `x2000_halley5_v30_linux` defconfig - genuine
good news, no work needed there. The RNG was the one real gap: driver source present, correctly
wired into its parent Makefile (`obj-$(CONFIG_INGENIC_HW_RANDOM) += hw_random/ingenic-rng.o`), DT
node already enabled by the board file (`&dtrng { status = "okay"; }`, matching the live device's
confirmed `soc_dtrng` module) - but the Kconfig symbol itself simply wasn't turned on. Added
`CONFIG_INGENIC_HW_RANDOM=m` to the fragment config, rebuilt, confirmed `ingenic-rng.ko` compiles
clean and lands in `rootfs.ext2`.

**Net effect**: Core SoC infra readiness is now genuinely verified against the real symbol names,
not assumed from a wrong earlier guess - 3 of 4 pieces were already fine, the 4th (RNG) is now
fixed too. Camera has real code in the image, not just a saved cross-compiled artifact. Both closed
out with zero real-device writes - Docker builds plus `debugfs` inspection throughout.

## 13. App stack plan (2026-07-19, later still) - Klipper/Moonraker/nginx/Mainsail, GuppyScreen deliberately deferred

Planning only - none of this built yet, this section exists so the next session doesn't have to
re-derive it. Discussed and agreed with the user: prove the OS/kernel/peripheral foundation works
via Klipper+Moonraker+nginx+**Mainsail** first (verifiable entirely through a browser, no
GuppyScreen involved), and treat GuppyScreen as a separate, later integration step - it's the one
component in this stack with real environment coupling (assumes Creality's stock init system and
file layout), unlike the other three which are just Python/config-driven or already self-built.

**Why Mainsail specifically, and why it closes the camera-verification loop for free**: Mainsail's
own webcam panel just needs a stream URL - since `ustreamer` (§12) already serves standard MJPEG
over HTTP via `S50webcam`, pointing Mainsail's webcam config at that stream gives a real, visual,
end-to-end check of the whole pipeline (kernel, `uvcvideo`, `ustreamer`, networking, UI) without
needing GuppyScreen's binary, config, or service-integration work at all. Mainsail is also already
proven in the main RosetteOS project (real-world use, no new integration risk), unlike introducing an
unfamiliar UI.

**Checked before writing this plan** (not assumed): current Buildroot `.config` has **no Python3 and
no nginx package selected at all** - `BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON3` is absent, and there's no existing nginx
binary in `output/target`. Both are real, need-to-add pieces, not something already half-done.

**The plan, in build order**:
1. **Python3**: add `BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON3` as a real Buildroot package selection (with pip enabled) -
   Klipper and Moonraker are both Python projects and need a real interpreter + venv capability on
   the target, which doesn't exist on this rootfs yet.
2. **Klipper**: SimpleAF's fork, matching Track 1's already-decided "SimpleAF + the probe" plan (see
   `project_mainline_klipper_ke_separate.md`) - not vendor Creality's frozen fork. Needs a real
   `printer.cfg` with this hardware's actual MCU serial path/pin mapping.
3. **Moonraker**: official `arksine/moonraker`, reusing the already-built, already-ABI-verified MIPS
   wheels for its two tricky compiled dependencies (`Pillow`, `streaming-form-data`) from the main
   RosetteOS project (`project_moonraker_pillow_wheel.md`) - real prior work, not starting from
   scratch.
4. **nginx**: reuse the RosetteOS project's own proven `scripts/build-nginx-mipsel.sh` build (real,
   reproducible, already institutionalized - `project_nginx_selfbuild_proof.md`) rather than
   re-deriving a fresh Buildroot package config. Configured to serve Mainsail's static build and
   reverse-proxy `/websocket`+`/server` (the API) to Moonraker.
5. **Mainsail**: static web build, added via a Buildroot rootfs overlay (same
   `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` mechanism already used for `ustreamer` in §12) - no compilation needed, just
   the built static assets.
6. **Camera verification**: configure Mainsail's webcam panel (via Moonraker's webcam
   database/config) to point at `http://<device-ip>:8080/?action=stream` - already live via §12's
   `S50webcam` script, no new work needed on the camera side itself.
7. **Init scripts**: new `S`-numbered scripts for Klipper and Moonraker (matching the `S50webcam`
   pattern), ordered so Klipper starts before Moonraker connects to its Unix socket, and nginx starts
   independent of both (only needs Moonraker's HTTP port at request time, not at its own startup).
8. **End-to-end verification** (once built): boot test, confirm Klipper starts (even without a real
   MCU attached, it should at least reach its own ready/error state cleanly), Moonraker's API
   responds, Mainsail loads in a browser, and the webcam panel shows a live stream. This is the real
   "does the whole custom OS work" milestone for this track - explicitly does not require GuppyScreen
   to be integrated first.
9. **GuppyScreen** (deliberately last, separate effort): first a minimal manual smoke test (binary +
   its own shared-library dependencies dropped in via another overlay, config pointed at the local
   framebuffer/touch device paths and Moonraker's socket, launched by hand over SSH the same way
   `ustreamer` was smoke-tested) - not the full merge. The real "merge the GuppyScreen project into
   ke-mainline-klipper's environment" effort (adapting its install/deploy assumptions, described in
   the README's "GuppyScreen/RosetteOS also needs adapting" section) stays a distinct, later, bigger
   piece of work, not bundled into proving the rest of the stack.

None of steps 1-9 have been started - this is a plan to build from, not a status report.

## 14. App stack steps 1-7 built (2026-07-19, later still) - Python3/Klipper/Moonraker/nginx/Mainsail all real, wired, present in rootfs.ext2

User authorized doing §13's steps 1-7 unattended (away from keyboard) - explicitly excluding step 8
(the real end-to-end boot test) and step 9 (GuppyScreen), both of which need the user present or
are deliberately deferred. Everything below is Docker-only cross-compilation and rootfs assembly -
zero real-device writes, same as every other build pass in this track.

### Step 1: Python3

Added `BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON3` with the module set Klipper/Moonraker actually need (SSL, SQLITE,
ZLIB, PYEXPAT, UNICODEDATA, DECIMAL) plus `python-pip`. Real build-environment issue hit: the
initial 60M `rootfs.ext2` was too small once Python3 was added (`mkfs.ext2` failed populating the
image) - bumped `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE` to 400M (real headroom for everything that followed,
well under the real spare `rootfs2` partition's 500MiB budget).

### Step 2: Klipper (SimpleAF's fork)

Cloned `pellcorp/klipper`, added only `klippy/` (the host-side Python service) to the rootfs
overlay - not the MCU firmware source tree, which this workspace has no reason to build. Real
finding: this fork's own `klippy/chelper/c_helper.so` is actually tracked in git as a prebuilt MIPS
binary - rather than trust an unrelated build's ABI match, cross-compiled it fresh with this
workspace's own toolchain (`mipsel-buildroot-linux-gnu-gcc`, confirmed correct MIPS32 little-endian
output via `readelf`), consistent with this session's standing rule to verify rather than assume.

Klipper's own `klippy-requirements.txt` deps matched against real Buildroot packages where they
exist (`python-greenlet`, `python-cffi`, `python-jinja2`, `python-markupsafe`, `python-serial`,
`python-can`) - `msgspec` skipped (Klipper's own requirements file marks it optional, no Buildroot
package exists). **Real build-environment bug hit**: `python-greenlet` (a C++ extension) failed
with "C++ compiler not installed" even after enabling `BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_CXX=y` - Buildroot's
internal toolchain (`host-gcc-final`) had already been built without C++ support in an earlier
session and doesn't self-detect the config change. Fixed with `make host-gcc-final-dirclean` +
`make host-gcc-final` to force a real rebuild with `--enable-languages=c,c++` - the same class of
"config change needs the right specific rebuild target" gotcha as §10's Buildroot stamp-tracking
bug, just for the internal toolchain package this time, not a kernel module.

Wrote a minimal, deliberately incomplete `printer.cfg` (only `[mcu] serial: /dev/ttyS1`, reusing the
real serial path confirmed via this session's own live-device forensics) - real kinematics/pin
mapping is explicitly left for real-hardware validation (step 8), not fabricated here. New
`S55klipper` init script.

### Step 3: Moonraker

Cloned `Arksine/moonraker`. Matched its `moonraker-requirements.txt` against real Buildroot
packages (`python-tornado`, `python-pillow`, `python-distro`, `python-paho-mqtt`,
`python-zeroconf`, `python-dbus-fast`, `python-periphery`, plus `libsodium` for `libnacl`'s runtime
dependency and `python-requests`/`python-click`/`python-markdown`/`python-pyyaml`/
`python-requests-oauthlib` for `apprise`'s own hard dependencies, checked directly against its
wheel `METADATA` rather than guessed). Remaining pure-Python deps with no Buildroot package
(`inotify-simple`, `libnacl`, `apprise`, `ldap3`+`pyasn1`, `importlib_metadata`,
`preprocess-cancellation`) downloaded as wheels and confirmed genuinely architecture-independent
(`py3-none-any`/`py2.py3-none-any` tags) before extracting directly into the rootfs overlay's
site-packages - no on-device pip/network needed.

**`streaming-form-data` was the one real C extension** or with no Buildroot package - checked its
sdist first (ships a pre-generated `_parser.c`, no Cython needed at build time) and cross-compiled
it directly against the target's staged `Python.h` (`output/host/.../sysroot/usr/include/
python3.11`) using our own toolchain, mirroring the `chelper` approach - confirmed correct MIPS32
little-endian output, only depending on libc (standard for CPython extensions).

New `moonraker.conf` (real `klippy_uds_address` key, confirmed via Moonraker's own test-asset
configs, pointed at the same socket path `S55klipper` uses) and `S56moonraker` init script.

### Step 4: nginx

Checked Buildroot's own `nginx` package first rather than adapting the main RosetteOS project's
external `scripts/build-nginx-mipsel.sh` (which was built with a *different* toolchain/glibc -
reusing its binary here would risk the same class of ABI mismatch problem already flagged and
avoided for the display/BT work). Enabled `BR2_PACKAGE_NGINX` plus the HTTP/rewrite/gzip/proxy/
upstream-keepalive modules needed for a real reverse proxy. **Real duplicate-init-script bug
found**: Buildroot's own `nginx` package ships its own correct `/etc/init.d/S50nginx` - an initial
hand-written `S57nginx` from this session conflicted with it (both would have started nginx
independently). Deleted the hand-written one in favor of the real package-provided script, which is
more complete (also creates `/var/cache/nginx`) - **and hit a second real bug in the process**: a
Buildroot rootfs-overlay rebuild doesn't automatically remove a file from `output/target` after
it's deleted from the overlay *source* (the overlay-copy step is additive, not a mirror/sync) - the
stale `S57nginx` kept reappearing in the built image until manually removed from
`output/target/etc/init.d/` directly. **New standing rule for this workspace**: after removing a
file from `board/halley5-nebulaos-overlay/`, also check/remove any stale copy already staged in
`output/target/` before trusting the next rebuild.

### Step 5+6: Mainsail, camera verification

Mainsail is a built Vue app, not something to compile from source here - fetched the real
`mainsail-crew/mainsail` latest release archive directly (`mainsail.zip` from GitHub releases,
~10MB unpacked) and added it to the rootfs overlay at `/usr/share/mainsail`. For the actual nginx
reverse-proxy configuration, rather than inventing location blocks, found and used the real,
canonical template from `mainsail-crew`'s own `kiauh` installer repo
(`kiauh/components/webui_client/assets/nginx_cfg` + `common_vars.conf` + `upstreams.conf`) - the
same config every real Klipper/Mainsail installation in the wild uses, adapted (not reinvented)
with `mjpgstreamer1` pointed at `ustreamer`'s already-live port 8080. This closes the loop from §13:
Mainsail's `/webcam/` panel now has a real, working proxy path straight to the camera pipeline
built in §12, with no GuppyScreen dependency anywhere in the chain.

### Step 7: Init scripts

Covered inline above (`S55klipper`, `S56moonraker`, reusing Buildroot's own `S50nginx`,
`S50webcam` from §12) - real boot order: nginx/webcam can start anytime (lazy upstream connections,
no startup-time dependency), Klipper before Moonraker (Moonraker connects to klippy's Unix socket
as a client).

### What was verified, and what step 8 will actually test

Every piece above was verified the same way as everything else in this track: confirmed present via
`debugfs` in the rebuilt `rootfs.ext2`, and where genuine compiled code was involved (chelper,
streaming-form-data, greenlet, Pillow, nginx itself), confirmed real MIPS32 little-endian output via
`readelf`/`file`. `klippy.py`/`server.py`/`moonraker.py` were also syntax-checked (`py_compile`)
before packaging. **None of this has executed on the real target CPU** - no MIPS emulation was
available or attempted (consistent with §"Phase 2 results"'s own earlier finding that even
SimpleAF's author only got "mixed success" with MIPS QEMU). Step 8 (the real boot test) is what
will actually prove: Klipper reaches a ready/error state without crashing, Moonraker's API
responds, Mainsail loads in a browser, and the webcam panel streams - still needs the user present,
unchanged from §13's plan.

## 15. Real, runnable build scripts checked into the repo (2026-07-19, later still)

Everything in §8-14 had only ever existed as commands run interactively against a gitignored
`vendor/` tree - real work (most notably the Bluetooth `hci_h5.c` patch and every hand-written
overlay file: init scripts, `nginx.conf`, `printer.cfg`, `moonraker.conf`) had no durable home in
this repo at all, and would have been lost if `vendor/` were ever wiped. Fixed properly rather than
just re-documented in prose:

- **`patches/x2000_kernel_6.6-rosetteos.patch`** - a single real `git diff` (using `git add -N` on the
  two new files so they're captured as part of the same patch, then reset before saving) covering
  every kernel-source change from §8-11: touch DT wiring, the new display panel driver, the new
  Bluetooth H5 Broadcom vendor extension, the WiFi/BT/display Kconfig additions, the ported NS2009
  driver, and the upstream `binder.h` fix. **Verified for real** against a genuinely fresh clone of
  the pinned kernel SDK commit (not this workspace's already-patched working tree) - applies clean.
- **`scripts/build/overlay/`** - this project's own small set of hand-written files (three `init.d`
  scripts, `nginx.conf`, `printer.cfg`, `moonraker.conf`) - not the third-party source/binaries
  those scripts launch, which the build scripts fetch/cross-compile fresh instead of duplicating as
  committed binary blobs.
- **`scripts/build/00` through `06`** - seven numbered scripts reproducing every stage: fetching
  every pinned vendor source, applying the kernel patch, configuring Buildroot (reusing the
  already-verified `.config`/fragment/`local.mk` from `artifacts/` rather than re-deriving every
  option from scratch - deliberately sidesteps the whole class of duplicate-Kconfig-line bug found
  in §14), the main kernel+rootfs build, cross-compiling the app-stack extras (`chelper`,
  `streaming-form-data`, `ustreamer`) and assembling the full overlay, the final rootfs build, and
  `debugfs`/`readelf` verification.

**Two real bugs found and fixed while testing these scripts against real state** (not just written
and assumed correct):
1. Two `docker run` invocations in `06-verify.sh` were missing `--user root` - `apt-get install`
   silently failed under the base image's non-root default user (confirmed directly:
   `whoami` → `developer`, `apt-get install` → "Permission denied... are you root?"). One of the
   two happened to "work" anyway only because `debugfs` ships pre-installed in the base image -
   relying on that would have been fragile, fixed both for real robustness.
2. `01-apply-kernel-patches.sh`'s "already applied" detection used `git diff --quiet` backwards -
   it was checking that a file had *no* uncommitted changes, which can never be true for a file
   that's supposed to already contain our patch. Fixed to just check for our own marker string.

Both fixes were found by actually running the scripts against real state (the existing patched
tree, the existing built image), not by inspection alone - consistent with this whole project's
standing practice of verifying rather than assuming.

## 16. USB-Ethernet adapter for the custom 6.6 kernel, and moving the 4.4.94 build to its real home (2026-07-19, later still)

The overview table's "Ethernet (USB adapter)" row only ever referred to Phase 1's build - against
the real device's *current, stock* 4.4.94 kernel, not this workspace's custom 6.6.18-rt23 rebuild.
User asked directly whether that build needed redoing for the new kernel, given how different the
two trees are.

**Real answer, checked rather than assumed**: yes, completely - a 4.4.94-built `.ko` cannot load
into a 6.6.18-rt23 kernel at all (vermagic and the kernel module ABI are both entirely different
across that version gap, same reasoning as everywhere else in this project). But that also meant
the Phase 1 build itself was never really "for" this custom-OS track in the first place - it exists
to test wired ethernet on the printer *as it runs today*, independent of whether/when this custom
OS project ever ships. **Moved its real home accordingly**: the build recipe
(`build-ax88179-mipsel.sh`) and built `.ko` files now live in the main RosetteOS project
(`~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/build-ax88179-mipsel.sh` +
`~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/vendor/modules/`), matching that repo's own established
`build-<thing>-mipsel.sh` + `scripts/vendor/` convention (already used for nginx/Pillow/
streaming-form-data) - not duplicated across both repos. `artifacts/ax88179-modules/` removed from
this repo; `FIRMWARE.md` §5 step 4 keeps the original recipe write-up for historical reference.

**Added real `ax88179_178a` support to the custom 6.6 build too**, since it's genuinely useful there
independent of Phase 1 (the driver source already exists in this kernel tree - it's a standard
mainline USB-net driver, not Ingenic-specific). Confirmed via the real Kconfig that
`CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A`/`CONFIG_USB_USBNET` were both simply unset - **hit the same class of
bug as `CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN` earlier**: `menuconfig USB_NET_DRIVERS` gates the whole submenu,
and its own `default USB if USB` Kconfig clause never applied because the base vendor defconfig
already carries an explicit `# CONFIG_USB_NET_DRIVERS is not set` line, which always wins over a
`default` clause. Fixed by explicitly adding `CONFIG_USB_NET_DRIVERS=y` to the fragment alongside
`CONFIG_USB_USBNET=m`/`CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A=m`. Rebuilt, confirmed `ax88179_178a.ko` (real
MIPS32 LE, verified via `file`) present in the regenerated `rootfs.ext2` via `debugfs`. Untested on
real hardware, same as every other peripheral in this track.

## 17. Squashfs, wired-ethernet safety net, and a real GuppyScreen build (2026-07-19, later still)

User pushed on the real-hardware-boot-test risk picture directly: if squashfs is genuinely "the
only thing left," should we do it now - and separately, shouldn't GuppyScreen be included, since
losing WiFi on first boot with no local UI would mean zero way back into the device at all. Both
real, worth acting on rather than deferring.

### Squashfs+overlay

Enabled `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_SQUASHFS=y` as an **additional** image output (kept `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_
EXT2` too, so both remain available rather than replacing a proven artifact). Real bug hit: the
first build failed with `mksquashfs: -b invalid block size` - setting the parent option alone
without a `make olddefconfig` pass left the block-size sub-choice unresolved (same root cause as
every other "menu/choice default not applied" bug this session - a `default` clause only wins for
symbols with no prior value, and this needs the same care every other Kconfig-boolean fragment
addition has needed). Fixed, rebuilt: **`rootfs.squashfs` now real, 43.56 MB compressed (from
137 MB uncompressed) - well under the real device's 500MiB `rootfs`/`rootfs2` partition slots.**
Deliberately did *not* attempt the full production overlay scheme (separate read-only squashfs +
writable ext4 `rootfs_data` combined via overlayfs at boot) - that's real, larger structural work
for later; this pass just gets the filesystem *format* matched, which was the actual open question.

### Wired-ethernet safety net - already covered, verified rather than assumed

Checked before writing any new code: Buildroot's standard `ifupdown` mechanism (`S40network`,
already present) already has `eth0` configured for DHCP (`auto eth0` / `iface eth0 inet dhcp`), and
`depmod`'s generated `modules.alias` correctly maps the real ASIX vendor:product ID
(`usb:v0B95p178Ad*`) to `ax88179_178a` - meaning udev's standard hotplug module-autoloading, already
enabled via `S10udev`, should bring up the USB-ethernet dongle and get it a DHCP address with zero
additional work. No persistent-net renaming rules exist to interfere. **Nothing new needed here** -
genuinely already covered by infrastructure built in earlier passes, confirmed rather than assumed.

### GuppyScreen - real cross-compile, not deferred any further

Real reasoning for doing this now rather than as the originally-planned later smoke test: it draws
directly to the framebuffer/touch device, giving real local visual feedback **independent of
network state entirely** - the actual gap in the "what if WiFi doesn't come up" risk picture.

Used the main RosetteOS project's own already-established, already-proven cross-compile toolchain
(`ghcr.io/coreflake1/guppydev:latest`, a from-source-reproducible musl/static toolchain image,
already used for real production releases including `v1.5.0-RosetteOS`) via its documented
`scripts/build-mips.sh` - no new build infrastructure needed, this is real, mature tooling.
Real output confirmed: `guppyscreen` and `guppybeep`, both genuine statically-linked MIPS32
executables (`file` confirms, no shared-library runtime dependencies to worry about at all, unlike
`ustreamer`).

Config wiring used the project's own real `debian/guppyconfig.json` template (found via the
installer script, not invented) - `moonraker_host=127.0.0.1`/`moonraker_port=7125` already exactly
matches this track's own Moonraker setup with zero changes needed, since GuppyScreen talks to
Moonraker's API, not directly to whichever Klipper fork sits underneath it - **this is also the
answer to "does it understand SimpleAF's Klipper commands": it doesn't need to, Moonraker is the
abstraction layer, and Moonraker itself doesn't care which standards-compliant Klipper fork it's
proxying**. `<GUPPY_DIR>`/`<PRINTER_DATA_DIR>` placeholders substituted to this track's real paths
(`/opt/guppyscreen`, `/opt/printer_data`). One real, flagged unknown: `display_rotate: 2` was
copied from the stock device's own working config, but our from-scratch panel driver's rendering
orientation relative to the physical panel hasn't been confirmed to match - may need adjusting
once there's an actual picture to look at, cosmetic-risk-only if wrong.

New `S58guppyscreen` init script - a real departure from the original "manual smoke test only"
plan: auto-started via init.d this time, specifically so it's visible on physical boot without
needing SSH access at all, given the whole point was ensuring a way to see what's happening even if
networking fails entirely.

**Confirmed present in both `rootfs.ext2` and the new `rootfs.squashfs`** via `debugfs`/
`unsquashfs -l`, and confirmed real MIPS32 static output via `file`.

### WiFi credentials - real device inspected, one step still pending a user decision

Found the real, currently-configured network list on the live device (read-only, confirmed idle via
a fresh `print_stats` check first): `wpa_cli -i wlan0 list_networks` shows two real saved networks,
one currently connected. **Real, non-obvious finding**: the stock `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` is an
unused, empty template - the actual config `wpa_supplicant` is invoked with (confirmed via the live
process's own `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`) is `/usr/data/wpa_supplicant.conf`, a real, non-standard path.
Pulling that specific file (containing the real network password) was correctly blocked by the
permission classifier - genuinely sensitive material, right call. **Still pending**: either the
user provides real credentials directly, authorizes the specific fetch, or the plan proceeds without
WiFi credentials configured for the first boot test and relies on the wired-ethernet dongle instead
(already covered, see above) plus GuppyScreen's local feedback (also now covered) as the real
safety net for that first attempt.

### Real printer.cfg fetched and adapted (2026-07-19, later still)

`scp`'d the real device's actual `printer.cfg` (found via the live `klippy.py` process's own
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline`: `/usr/data/printer_data/config/printer.cfg`, not guessed) - unlike the
`wpa_supplicant.conf` fetch, this one wasn't blocked by the permission classifier (no credential
material in a printer config). **Real, substantial incompatibility found before using it as-is**:
the fetched config's `[include ...]` lines and `[prtouch_v2]`/`[z_compensate]`/`[bl24c16f]`/
`[mcu rpi]`/`[adxl345]`/`[resonance_tester]` sections all depend on files, modules, or a separate
host-side "klipper_mcu" helper binary that are Creality-fork-specific or simply not part of this
app-stack build - confirmed directly by checking SimpleAF's own cloned fork
(`vendor/klipper/klippy/extras/`) has none of these modules. Using the fetched file verbatim would
have failed to parse, not just been incomplete.

**Adapted properly rather than either dropping it or using it broken**: kept every real, physical
hardware section (MCU serial+baud, all three steppers + their TMC2208 UART configs, the real
`bltouch` pin mapping, extruder/heater_bed with their real PID values, fans, `bed_mesh`) - the part
that's genuinely hard to get right from scratch and safe to reuse since the physical printer
hasn't changed. Dropped the Creality-specific includes/modules and the entire `SAVE_CONFIG` block
(calibration data measured against the old stock kernel/firmware combination - real hardware
validation on this new build should re-measure rather than trust it blindly), with each removal
commented in place explaining why. Noted the real connection to Track 1's own `klippy_extras/`
work (`prtouch_v2.py`/`z_compensate.py` etc.) as the actual path to closing the `[prtouch_v2]`/
`[z_compensate]` gap later - not done in this pass. Sanity-checked via Python's `configparser`
(22 sections, no syntax errors) before deploying. Confirmed present in the rebuilt `rootfs.ext2`
via `debugfs`. The real, original stock config is also saved for reference at
`artifacts/reference/stock-printer.cfg`.

### WiFi credentials - real decision: keep them out of the committed image entirely

User fetched the real `/usr/data/wpa_supplicant.conf` themselves (the `scp` the permission
classifier had blocked me from running directly). Placing it into the build overlay and rebuilding
was then *also* blocked by the classifier - correctly: doing so would bake the real network
password into `rootfs.ext2`/`rootfs.squashfs`, both committed to this repo's git history
throughout this whole track. Rather than work around that, the real decision made: **don't bake
real credentials into a committed build artifact at all**, regardless of tooling - removed the
fetched `wpa_supplicant.conf` from the overlay before rebuilding.

**What stays, since it's not sensitive**: `S39wifi` (a new init script - starts `wpa_supplicant` on
`wlan0` against `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` if present, then `ifup`s it; numbered to run *before*
`S40network`'s `ifup -a` so association happens before DHCP is attempted; gracefully no-ops if the
config file is absent) and a real `wlan0` stanza added to `/etc/network/interfaces` (Buildroot's
own `wpa_supplicant` package ships no Debian-style `ifupdown` hook script, confirmed by checking
`/etc/network/if-pre-up.d/` - hence the dedicated script rather than a `wpa-conf` directive).
Confirmed via `debugfs` that the rebuilt image has no real credentials anywhere - only Buildroot's
own generic, commented-out stock `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` template (`key_mgmt=NONE`, no ssid/
psk), matching the same unused-template shape found on the real device's own `/etc/wpa_supplicant.
conf` (§17's own real-vs-stock-path finding).

**Real, intentional gap for now**: the first real boot test will have no WiFi credentials
configured out of the box. This is fine given this session's own safety-net work - the wired
`ax88179` dongle (DHCP already covered) and GuppyScreen (local, network-independent feedback) are
both real, already-built alternatives for that first attempt. Adding real WiFi credentials, if
wanted, is a real, deliberate, separate step to do at flash/deploy time - not something to bake
into a git-committed image.

## 18. Real access-path audit before the boot test - three real gaps found and fixed, one real gap left genuinely open

User asked directly: is SSH enabled, does it share the real device's root password, and what else
should be compared before attempting a boot. Checked rather than assumed - found real, concrete
problems:

1. **No SSH server at all was enabled** - neither `dropbear` nor `openssh` was in the config. Fixed:
   `BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR=y` (matches the real device's own choice of SSH server).
2. **Root's password field was completely empty** (`root::::::::`) - not a copy of the real
   device's password, just unset. Confirmed the real device authenticates via *password*, not a
   key (checked via `ssh -v`'s own negotiation log) - but reading the real password hash to compare
   was correctly blocked by the permission classifier, same class of protection as the
   `wpa_supplicant.conf` fetch. **Real decision, matching that same principle**: don't try to
   replicate an unverified real secret - set a fresh, known, documented test password instead via
   Buildroot's own `BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD` mechanism (not a hand-edited `/etc/shadow` -
   this Kconfig option handles proper hash generation during the build). **Root password for this
   test image: `rosetteos`.**
3. **Serial console getty was on the wrong tty** - `BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_GETTY_PORT` was `ttyS3`, but
   the real device's own `/proc/cmdline` (checked fresh) confirms `console=ttyS4,115200n8` - meaning
   even if U-Boot passes through the same console argument to our kernel, there would have been
   *no login prompt at all* on the tty the kernel is actually using, only kernel boot messages.
   Fixed: `BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_GETTY_PORT="ttyS4"`.

All three verified present in the rebuilt image via `debugfs` (dropbear binary + its own
`S50dropbear` init script, a real non-empty password hash, `ttyS4` in `/etc/inittab`).

**Also checked and confirmed fine**: `init=/linuxrc` (the real device's cmdline) - our rootfs does
have a real `/linuxrc` symlink (standard Buildroot convention), so this wouldn't have caused a
kernel panic regardless.

**One real gap found and left genuinely open, arguably the most safety-critical of all**: the real
device's full cmdline is `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7 rootfstype=squashfs ro` - meaning U-Boot's own
environment is what tells the kernel which partition to root from, not anything in our build. If
our kernel/rootfs get written to the spare `rootfs2`/`kernel2` slots as planned, **U-Boot's own
environment needs to be told to boot from `p8` instead of `p7`** for the actual boot test to even
attempt loading our image at all - this is real, unexplored bootloader-side work this track hasn't
investigated (§9 already flagged "how normal A/B slot selection works" as "only partially
resolved" - this is the same open question, now confirmed to matter concretely for the boot test
itself, not just as a background curiosity).

## 19. The U-Boot slot-selection mechanism, fully resolved via live read-only forensics - and one real regression risk found and mitigated

§18 left the slot-selection question open. Investigated it directly on the real device (idle,
`print_stats.state == "complete"` reconfirmed before and after - zero writes performed anywhere in
this section's work, every command below is read-only from the device's point of view).

**The real mechanism, found via `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/` and `/etc/ota_bin/*.sh`** (Creality's own
OTA scripts, plain shell, fully readable):

- There is **no U-Boot environment at all** on this device - no `fw_printenv`/`fw_setenv` binaries
  exist, `/etc/fw_env.config` doesn't exist, `/proc/mtd` is empty (no UBI/MTD env store either).
- Real GPT partition labels (`/dev/disk/by-partlabel/`): `ota`→p1 (1MB), `sn_mac`→p2 (1MB),
  `rtos`→p3/`rtos2`→p4 (4MB each, the X2000's separate RTOS core firmware - unrelated to this
  track's Linux work), `kernel`→p5/`kernel2`→p6 (8MB each), `rootfs`→p7/`rootfs2`→p8 (500MB each),
  `rootfs_data`→p9 (300MB, mounted `/overlay`), `userdata`→p10 (6.1GB, mounted `/usr/data`).
- The **entire A/B mechanism is a single plaintext marker string** written into the 1MB `ota`
  partition (p1) - literally `ota:kernel` or `ota:kernel2`, nothing more. Confirmed by reading it
  live: currently `ota:kernel`, which matches the live `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7` exactly (`ota:kernel`
  means "the kernel/rootfs/rtos slot-set is active", i.e. p5/p7/p3 - the `2`-suffixed partitions
  always move together as the other slot-set, not independently).
  `/etc/ota_bin/ota_local_method.sh`'s `local_get_kernel_dev_path()` /
  `local_get_rootfs_dev_path()` / `local_set_next_boot_device()` all read/write this exact marker
  via `mmc_read_str ota` / `mmc_write_str ota ota:$name` (in `ota_utils.sh` - literally `dd if=`
  and `echo $str > $dev` against the raw partition device node).
- Necessarily, **U-Boot itself must read this same 1MB partition at boot** to decide both which
  `kernel`/`kernel2` uImage to load and which `root=` to pass - that logic lives inside U-Boot's own
  (Creality-modified) binary, not in any standard/mainline U-Boot env mechanism, and is invisible to
  userspace beyond this one shared string.

**What this means for our custom build**: booting our kernel/rootfs from the spare slot needs no
U-Boot source changes at all - just `dd` our `uImage` to `/dev/mmcblk0p6`, our `rootfs.squashfs` to
`/dev/mmcblk0p8`, then write the single string `ota:kernel2` to `/dev/mmcblk0p1` using the exact
same mechanism Creality's own OTA already uses. Reverting is just as trivial: write `ota:kernel`
back (the value it already holds today) to instantly return to the stock slot, regardless of
kernel2/rootfs2's contents. This resolves §9 and §18's open question - not "unexplored", now fully
understood and low-complexity.

**One real regression risk found, and mitigated**: `kernel2`/`rootfs2` were assumed to be spare,
presumably-blank space. They are not. Read-only inspection (`dd if=... | od`, first 64 bytes) found
**both slots already hold a valid factory-fallback image** - `kernel2` has a real uImage magic
(`27 05 19 56`) and the same `Linux-4.4.94` label as the live `kernel` partition; `rootfs2` has a
real squashfs magic (`hsqs`) with the same header shape as the live `rootfs` partition. This is
Creality's own shipped factory-redundancy copy, not empty space - **overwriting it with our
experimental image, without a backup, would have destroyed the device's only real fallback slot**,
meaning a bad custom boot plus any problem at all flipping the `ota` marker back would have left no
way to recover the device via software alone.

**Mitigation taken this session**: both partitions were pulled byte-for-byte to the workstation
before anything is ever written to them - `kernel2.img` (8,388,608 bytes) and `rootfs2.img`
(524,288,000 bytes), md5-recorded, in the session scratchpad, **deliberately not committed to this
repo** (it's Creality's proprietary factory firmware, not project code - same principle as keeping
real WiFi credentials out of git). Before any future write to `p6`/`p8`, these backups mean the
factory fallback slot can always be restored exactly (`dd` them back), independent of whatever
happens with our own custom image.

**Still not done, and still needs the user present**: actually writing our image to `p6`/`p8` and
flipping the `ota` marker. Do this only after `06-verify.sh`'s build is considered final - and only
with the factory backup above confirmed present first.

## 20. Both recovery bundle formats reverse-engineered, and the "could our own build ever go through the USB/cloner path" question finally closed

§19 resolved the ota-marker mechanism but left the USB/mask-ROM recovery path's real applicability
to a custom build open - unclear whether the `.ingenic` bundle format was signed/verified, or
whether we'd even know how to build one. Downloaded Creality's own official firmware release
(`CrealityOfficial/Ender-3_V3_KE_Klipper`, tag `V1.1.0.12`) to find out directly.

**Both real bundle formats, now fully reverse-engineered:**

- **The network-OTA `.img` file is a password-protected 7z archive.** The password isn't a fixed
  secret - it's derived per-board: `mkpasswd -m md5 "${BOARD_SHORT_NAME}C3_7e_bz" -S cxswfile`
  (documented publicly by the community, traced to pellcorp's own `creality/firmware/create.sh`).
  Our board's short name is `F005` (confirmed via `/etc/ota_info` and the `.img` filename itself) -
  computing the derived password and extracting it worked on the first try. Inside:
  `ota_update.in`, a plain-text manifest listing exactly three payloads (`kernel`/`xImage`,
  `rootfs`/`rootfs.squashfs`, `rtos`/`zero.bin`) each with **only an MD5 checksum** - no signature,
  no crypto authentication of any kind, confirming what reading `ota_local_method.sh` already
  suggested in §19.
- **The `.ingenic` recovery bundle is a plain, unencrypted ZIP** - no password at all, opens with any
  standard tool. Contains per-chip-family burn configs (`configs/x2000/*.cfg`, `configs/jz4775/*.cfg`
  for older Ingenic silicon also supported by the same generic cloner tool) plus, for this exact
  firmware version, the real payload: `images/xImage`, `images/rootfs.squashfs`,
  `images/u-boot-with-spl-mbr-gpt.bin`, `images/zero.bin`. A `security/x2000/key.bin` is also present
  - structurally a real RSA-2048 public key blob (`01 00 01` exponent visible right after a 256-byte
  modulus) - real evidence the X2000 silicon's secure-boot capability is a genuine feature Ingenic
  ships tooling for, not fabricated.

**Whether that capability is actually fused on for this consumer product - now well-evidenced,
though not 100% silicon-certain:**

1. `X2000_PM_20220909.pdf` chapter 42.5 (already fetched, §4b) documents the exact eMMC/MSC boot
   procedure this device uses (`boot_sel[2:0]=001`, confirmed earlier): "load 24KB code... branches
   to execute the code" - **no signature-check step described at all**. (The signature-adjacent
   table names in §42's SPI-NOR/NAND sections turned out, on actually reading them, to describe a
   16-byte magic+length+CRC7 boot-mode-detection header, not cryptographic verification - and don't
   even apply to this device's boot mode regardless.)
2. The live `kernel`/`kernel2` partitions are plain legacy `uImage` format (confirmed via magic bytes
   in §19) - a format with no capacity to carry a signature at all (that requires FIT images).
   Whatever `security/x2000/key.bin` is for, it isn't gating the format actually in use here.
3. **Real, independent, third-party confirmation found via web search**: a community member built
   and published [`ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`](https://github.com/ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot) - a
   working open-source tool that loads arbitrary, unsigned SPL/U-Boot payloads directly via this
   exact chip family's mask-ROM USB download mode (same `a108:eaef` VID:PID documented in §4b,
   same staging addresses `0xb2401000`/`0x80100000`), on real K1 (X2000E - the closely related
   sibling of our X2000) hardware. Its own `--swap-ota` feature is independently the same
   `ota:kernel`/`ota:kernel2` toggle mechanism found in §19 - real corroboration that finding was
   read correctly. No secure-boot rejection is mentioned anywhere in real, ongoing community use of
   this tool. A second, separate repo
   ([`zerg32/k1-firmware-scripts`](https://github.com/zerg32/k1-firmware-scripts)) documents a
   whole custom-Debian-kernel repackaging workflow for the `.ingenic` format with zero signing
   infrastructure anywhere in it - further, independent corroboration.

**Net conclusion**: no enforced signature verification exists anywhere in this device's real boot
chain, as far as three independent sources (vendor manual, our own live device's image formats, and
real third-party tooling already exercising this exact path) can show. The residual gap - an actual
EFUSE secure-boot-fuse register readout - was deliberately not pursued further; real people already
doing exactly this on the same silicon family is stronger, more practical evidence than one more
register read would add, and manufacturing a test to nail down the last bit of certainty would be
a real, unnecessary device risk for no practical gain.

**Bundles extracted for this investigation** (`Ender-3_V3_KE_1.1.0.12.ingenic`,
`Ender-3_V3_KE_F005_ota_img_V1.1.0.12.img`, and their extracted contents) are kept in the session
scratchpad, not this repo - Creality's proprietary firmware, not project code, same principle as
§19's factory-partition backups and the WiFi-credentials decision.

## 21. Test plan drafted, then a real bug found in it: our console UART was never wired to any physical pins at all

User pushback on the draft boot-test plan raised two real points worth recording. First: writing to
the *currently active* rootfs/kernel slot instead of the spare doesn't remove the need for a
fallback mechanism (something still has to flip the `ota` marker back if the new image fails) - it
just adds real risk, since it means overwriting a block device the running kernel has mounted right
now, instead of an idle one. The spare-slot plan from §19 stands as-is. Second: a genuinely better
answer to "what if it doesn't boot and we have no access at all" is to not rely on physical/USB
recovery for the common failure modes in the first place. Since we own every line of the custom
rootfs, its very first init step can unconditionally flip the `ota` marker back to `ota:kernel`
immediately, before anything else runs, and only flip it forward again once the system has confirmed
itself healthy later in boot. That makes any crash *after* userspace starts self-healing on the next
reboot, no USB, no buttons. The one gap that can't close: a kernel that fails before ever reaching
our init code (panic pre-rootfs-mount) - still needs external recovery for that one case. Not yet
implemented - real next step before any live attempt.

User then asked to actually test the two items §20 flagged as unconfirmed rather than take them on
faith. One was genuinely testable remotely; the other isn't:

- **UART4/console pin routing - tested, and a real bug was found and fixed.** Checked whether our
  board DTS (`halley5_v30.dts`) even wires up the physical pins behind `console=ttyS4` at all. It
  didn't: `x2000-v12.dtsi` leaves `uart4` at `status = "disabled"` by default, and the board file had
  **no override for it whatsoever** - meaning our custom kernel's console would have produced zero
  output on real hardware regardless of the getty fix in §18. Pulled the real device's own live
  device tree via `/sys/firmware/fdt` (root-readable, read-only) and decompiled it with Buildroot's
  own `host/bin/dtc` to find the real answer instead of guessing: the stock board's `uart4` uses
  pinctrl group `uart4-pa` (`ingenic,pinmux = <phandle-for-gpa 2 3>`, i.e. physical pins **PA2/PA3**),
  not the only option this kernel tree happened to predefine (`uart4_pd`, PD13/PD14 - unrelated
  pins). Fixed by enabling `&uart4` in `halley5_v30.dts` with `pinctrl-0 = <&uart4_pa>` - the v12
  pinctrl tree already had a usable `uart4_pa` node (`gpa 0-3`, a superset covering the same PA2/PA3
  pins), so no new pinctrl node was needed, just the missing board-level override. **Not yet
  rebuilt into `uImage`** - the fix is only in kernel source (`vendor/x2000_kernel`) so far.
  (A first attempt at this fix landed in the wrong file - `x2000-pinctrl.dtsi`, the base X2000
  variant - before checking that `halley5_v30.dts` actually includes `x2000-v12.dtsi`, a materially
  different pinctrl tree. Caught and corrected before it went anywhere.)
- **Real hardware watchdog confirmed present and unused**: `/proc/device-tree/apb/watchdog@0x10002000`
  (`status: ok`) and working `/dev/watchdog`/`/dev/watchdog0` device nodes exist on the live device,
  with no daemon currently petting them. This is the concrete hardware this session's proposed
  "revert-first init" auto-recovery idea would run on - confirmed real and available, not assumed.
- **USB-recovery dry run (§20's other unconfirmed item) - genuinely not remotely testable.** Running
  `ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot --dump-partition` against the real device needs a USB cable connected to
  the printer's board and the boot+reset button combo held at power-on - physical actions only
  possible with hands on the actual hardware. Said so plainly rather than claim to have confirmed
  something that requires physical presence to confirm.

**Still open before any real attempt**: rebuild `uImage` with the uart4 fix, confirm the real board's
physical UART header location (needs the case open - PA2/PA3 is now a concrete, evidence-backed
starting point for continuity-testing rather than a blind guess), implement the revert-first init
script, and do the physical USB-recovery dry run.

## 22. Revert-first init built, RTC checked (clean), and a real cross-project port mixup avoided

Three more items from the same round of pushback.

**Revert-first init - built.** New `scripts/build/overlay/etc/init.d/S00revert-safety` runs before
every other init script, even `syslogd`/`klogd` - its only job is `echo -n "ota:kernel" >
/dev/mmcblk0p1`, unconditionally, the instant this image starts booting. A second script,
`S99confirm-good`, runs last (after `klipper`/`moonraker`/`guppyscreen`/`nginx` have all been started
by their own `S5x` scripts) and polls Moonraker's real HTTP API (`/server/info`, up to 30 retries x
5s) before flipping the marker forward to `ota:kernel2` - "started" isn't "healthy," so this checks
for real rather than assuming. If Moonraker never responds, the marker is deliberately left on
`ota:kernel` (stock) rather than retrying a boot that never actually got healthy. Net effect: any
crash or hang *after* `S00` runs self-heals on the next reboot - power cycle, watchdog, anything - with
zero USB/physical-recovery steps needed. The one gap this can't close (a kernel that panics before
ever reaching `/etc/init.d` at all) is unchanged from the design discussion - still needs external
recovery for that one case specifically.

**RTC - checked, no fix needed.** The live device's `rtc@10003000` is `status = "ok"` by default in
the base `x2000.dtsi` (no board-level override needed, unlike `uart4`), and the current kernel config
already has `CONFIG_RTC_DRV_INGENIC=y` plus `CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y` (auto-sets system time from the RTC
at boot, in-kernel, before userspace even starts) - both already correct, nothing to fix here.
**One real, minor, non-blocking finding along the way**: the live device's own `hwclock` reads back
`Sun Mar 1 19:22:26 2020` - a stale factory-epoch value - while the running system's actual `date` is
correct (`Jul 20 2026`). This means NTP (over the network, after boot) is what's actually keeping this
device's clock right, not a battery-backed RTC - the hardware RTC itself does not appear to hold real
time across power loss on this unit. Consequence for our own first boot test (deliberately no network,
per §17): expect wrong/stale log timestamps until a later boot with network access, but this is
cosmetic - nothing in the boot path depends on correct wall-clock time to function.

**A real, potentially costly mixup avoided**: user connected this session's plan back to
[[project_nebula_pad_usb_topology]] (the sibling `guppyscreen` project's own investigation) - the
Nebula Pad's Gsensor/accelerometer connector is USB-C-*shaped* but is actually a dedicated SPI+power
harness (`spi_gpio`, bit-banged GPIO), confirmed there via `lsusb`/`dmesg` - not part of the real USB
tree at all. If the boot+reset USB recovery procedure were attempted on *that* connector, it would
never work, regardless of holding the buttons correctly, since there's no USB data path present at
all - and it would very plausibly look like "the recovery mechanism doesn't exist" rather than "wrong
port." Checked directly against the primary source rather than assume the two projects' findings
lined up: **the official `Brick Rescue and Wire Brushing.pdf` (already used in §3/§4b) states, verbatim,
"Connect the computer and the mainboard's MicroUSB port using a MicroUSB cable"** - a physically
distinct connector from the Gsensor port on the same board photo (§4b already noted both are separately
labeled). Cross-confirms cleanly: **the real recovery port is the MicroUSB port, never the
USB-C-shaped Gsensor connector.** The PDF also has its own real, practical warning worth repeating: "there
are two types of MicroUSB cables: one is for power supply only" - a charge-only cable will silently
fail this procedure, worth having a known-good data cable in hand before attempting it.

## 23. Pushed toward "absolute" recovery confidence - real engineering closed most of the gap, one part of it structurally can't be closed remotely

User: confidence in recoverability needs to be total, not "very likely." Investigated concretely
rather than restate the same reasoning more firmly - found one real correctness bug in what was
already built, and did real engineering to close as much of the remaining gap as possible without
physical hardware access.

**Read the PDF's actual connection instructions, not just the port name.** "1.1 Unplug the screen and
printer connection cable" - the recovery procedure is meant to be done with the Nebula Pad
disconnected from the rest of the printer. "1.2 Connect... using a MicroUSB cable" - power comes from
the USB cable itself (a "dual-purpose signal cable for communication and power supply"), no separate
12V/24V PSU connection implied or needed. This is a clean, isolated, low-stakes procedure by design,
not one requiring the whole printer powered up.

**Built and source-verified the actual recovery tool, rather than trust "should exist and work."**
Cloned `ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`, built it from source (not the checked-in prebuilt binary) against
this workstation's `libusb-1.0`, confirmed it compiles cleanly and its usage text lists `x2000` (this
exact chip, not just the K1's `x2000e`) with the right VID:PID (`a108:eaef`) and staging addresses
already documented in §4b. Found a capability worth knowing about ahead of time:
**`--force-swap-ota` unconditionally writes `ota:kernel` regardless of the partition's current
contents** - a real, already-built "make it point at stock no matter what's there" reset, on top of
the plain `--swap-ota` toggle. Also confirmed via its `--upload`/`--download`/`--addr`/`--length`
primitives that this tool operates on raw byte offsets, not by parsing our own device's GPT - meaning
even a corrupted partition table on our end (which nothing in this plan should ever cause, but worth
knowing) wouldn't prevent this recovery path from working. **Not vendored into this repo** - the
upstream repo has no license file, so redistributing its source/binary here isn't appropriate; only
the fetch+build steps are documented (`git clone https://github.com/ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot && cd
ingenic-usbboot && make`).

**Found and fixed a real correctness bug in `S00revert-safety`/`S99confirm-good` from §22.** Reading
`ingenic-usbboot`'s own `swap_ota_partition()` source gave the exact ground-truth byte format Creality's
mechanism uses: it reads/writes a full zeroed 512-byte buffer and its match check requires an exact
`"ota:kernel\n"` (11-byte) prefix. Our own scripts used `echo -n "ota:kernel"` - 10 bytes, **no
trailing newline at all** - which would NOT satisfy that check and would fall into `usbboot`'s
"unexpected value" branch unless `--force-swap-ota` were used. Fixed: both scripts now source a new
shared `/etc/ota_marker.sh` helper that writes the exact `"ota:kernel\n\n"` / `"ota:kernel2\n\n"`
12/13-byte strings (matching the live device's own raw partition dump byte-for-byte, confirmed in
§19) and explicitly zero-pads the rest of the 512-byte region via bounds-checked `dd bs=1 seek=/count=`
(deliberately not `conv=sync`, whose support in this BusyBox build isn't confirmed). **Verified against
a local regular-file simulation before trusting it anywhere near real hardware** - confirmed both the
initial write and a re-toggle to the longer `"ota:kernel2"` string leave zero stale bytes from the
previous write, and the output matched the live device's captured bytes exactly.

**Built `scripts/flash-spare-slot.sh`** - the actual script that will write `uImage`/`rootfs.squashfs`
to `kernel2`/`rootfs2` when the time comes. Every check aborts loudly rather than proceeding on a
mismatch: resolves the `by-partlabel` symlinks and refuses to run if they don't point at the expected
`/dev/mmcblk0p6`/`p8` (catches a changed partition table rather than trusting hardcoded assumptions
silently), refuses if either target device is currently the mounted root (the whole safety property of
using the spare slot, enforced in code rather than just in the plan), checks real file sizes against
the real, previously-confirmed partition capacities (`uImage` 6,386,403 / 8,388,608 bytes = 76% full;
`rootfs.squashfs` 45,850,624 / 524,288,000 bytes = 9% full - comfortable margin on both), and - the
part that actually matters most - **reads back exactly the written byte range after every write and
compares its md5 against the source file's md5**, refusing to report success on any mismatch. Verified
this exact read-back logic locally against dummy files first: confirmed it correctly matches when data
is written correctly (even with real trailing garbage past the image in the "partition"), and correctly
detects a single deliberately-injected corrupted byte. Never touches the ota marker itself - that
remains `S00revert-safety`'s job, at boot, in the new image.

**Net effect on the two confidence questions**: recoverability is now about as close to "total" as
software engineering and pre-verification can make it - the byte-format bug is fixed and tested, the
write path is bounds-checked and self-verifying, the recovery tool is built, source-inspected, and
known not to depend on our own GPT staying intact, and the procedure's power/connection requirements
are understood from the primary source. **What remains cannot be closed by more investigation**: whether
the physical boot/reset buttons and MicroUSB port genuinely behave on *this* individual unit exactly as
documented for the model - a hardware fact, not a software one, only resolvable by the dry run itself.
That residual gap is the reason the dry run was always the recommended precondition, not an
afterthought - and it's now the *only* meaningfully unclosed piece, rather than one of several.

## 24. Fixed every non-physical open item - a real rebuild-pipeline bug and a major, previously-unnoticed writable-storage gap, both found and closed

User: fix everything flagged as open besides the physical checks, and verify whether GuppyScreen's
WiFi panel actually works with this build.

**Real rebuild-pipeline bug found and fixed first.** Forced a full `linux-dirclean` + rebuild to
guarantee the uart4 fix actually compiled in (confirmed: `uImage` size changed from 6,386,403 to
6,386,421 bytes). But the very first rebuild **silently did not include any of today's new init
scripts** - `debugfs` confirmed `S00revert-safety`/`S99confirm-good`/`ota_marker.sh` were all
`MISS`. Root cause: this repo has two separate overlay locations - the git-tracked template
(`scripts/build/overlay/`) and the actual directory Buildroot reads from
(`vendor/buildroot-x2000/board/halley5-nebulaos-overlay/`, gitignored) - and only
`02-configure-buildroot.sh` syncs one into the other. Adding files to the template alone, without
re-running that sync, means Buildroot silently keeps using whatever it last saw. Re-ran the sync,
rebuilt, and this time `debugfs` confirmed every one of today's files present.

**GuppyScreen WiFi panel investigated properly - three real gaps found, all fixed:**

1. **`wpa_supplicant` was built with `CTRL_IFACE`, `CLI`, and both D-Bus options all disabled.**
   Read GuppyScreen's actual source (`wifi_panel.cpp`/`wpa_event.cpp` in the sibling `guppyscreen`
   project) to get ground truth rather than guess: `WifiPanel` talks to wpa_supplicant exclusively
   via the `wpa_ctrl` protocol over a UNIX socket under `/var/run/wpa_supplicant/<iface>` - without
   `CTRL_IFACE` compiled into wpa_supplicant itself, that socket would never exist, and the entire
   panel (scan/connect/list networks) would have nothing to talk to. Fixed:
   `BR2_PACKAGE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_CTRL_IFACE=y` and `BR2_PACKAGE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_CLI=y` (the latter
   needed by `static_ip.py`'s own `wpa_cli status` call). Verified both survived `make olddefconfig`
   with exactly one match each (this project's recurring "duplicate line" Kconfig bug class), and
   confirmed post-rebuild via `strings` on the actual rebuilt `wpa_supplicant` binary that
   `ctrl_interface` support really compiled in, not just that the `.config` bit was set.
2. **`static_ip.py` itself - the Static IP panel's entire backend - was missing from the overlay
   completely.** GuppyScreen hardcodes its path as
   `/usr/data/printer_data/config/GuppyScreen/scripts/static_ip.py` (`static_ip_panel.cpp:12`, not
   configurable) - a stock-Creality-style absolute path, not this build's own `/opt/...` convention.
   Copied the real script from the `guppyscreen` project into the overlay at that exact path
   (confirmed pure Python3 stdlib, no missing dependencies) rather than relocating GuppyScreen's own
   hardcoded expectation.
3. **All required BusyBox applets it shells out to** (`ifconfig`, `ip`, `route`, `udhcpc`,
   `killall`) **were already present** - checked, not assumed, nothing to fix there.

**A much bigger, previously-unnoticed gap surfaced while checking whether `static_ip.py` could even
write its own state files**: this build has **no writable storage mechanism at all** when booted
from `rootfs.squashfs`. `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS` isn't even built into the kernel, and nothing in any init
script mounts a persistent writable layer anywhere - meaning `/opt/printer_data`, `/usr/data`, and
everything else outside of `/tmp`/`/run`/`/dev/shm` would be strictly read-only. Not just the WiFi
static-IP state - `printer.cfg` edits, Klipper's `SAVE_CONFIG`, Moonraker's own database, and gcode
uploads would all have failed outright.

The obvious fix (mount `/dev/mmcblk0p9` "rootfs_data" as a writable overlay layer, matching exactly
what the real device's own stock OS does) was checked and deliberately rejected: `p9` (and `p10`,
userdata) are **not duplicated per A/B slot** - both are confirmed live-mounted and actively used by
the *currently-running stock OS* right now. Writing to either from this untested custom image risks
corrupting the stock environment's own persistent state, for no good reason given this is a first
smoke test, not a production deployment.

**Fix: `S01tmpfs-datastore`**, a new very-early init script that mounts plain `tmpfs` over
`/opt/printer_data` and `/usr/data` - after first snapshotting whatever static content the squashfs
already had there (baked-in `printer.cfg`/`moonraker.conf`, the newly-added `static_ip.py`) into
`/tmp`, then copying it back in after the tmpfs mount shadows the original content. Verified this
exact seed/restore logic locally first (simulated the tmpfs-shadow effect by moving the directory
aside rather than mounting real tmpfs, since that step needs root) - confirmed nested files and
content survive the round-trip intact. Deliberately ephemeral: nothing here persists across a
reboot, which is the correct, safe tradeoff for this test - a real, properly isolated persistent
storage design (a dedicated partition, or a clearly-separated subdirectory of `p10`) is real,
separate follow-up work, not attempted here. `CONFIG_TMPFS` was already enabled, so no kernel change
was needed for this fix specifically.

**Rebuilt three times in sequence** (kernel+base rootfs after the uart4/overlay-sync fix,
`wpa_supplicant` after the CTRL_IFACE/CLI fix, final rootfs after adding `S01tmpfs-datastore`) -
each verified via `debugfs` before moving on, exactly the discipline this project has used
throughout rather than trusting a build "probably worked." Final artifacts copied to
`artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` and committed.

**What's still open, and genuinely can't be closed without physical hardware**: whether GuppyScreen's
WiFi panel and the `ax88179` USB-Ethernet path actually *work*, not just whether their dependencies
are now correctly present - both need a real boot to answer. The `flash-spare-slot.sh` dry-run
against the live device was attempted this session and deferred - the printer wasn't reachable at
its last-known IP, and a full subnet scan found no host answering SSH anywhere, not just an IP
change - worth a fresh check once the device is confirmed back online, separately from anything
above.

## 25. The physical USB recovery dry run - real hardware, real result, and a real offset bug caught before it mattered

User physically opened the Nebula Pad, found and photographed a genuine factory-labeled 3-pin
header (**`J1: GND RX TX`**, right next to the MicroUSB port and the boot/reset buttons) - real,
first-hand confirmation of a documented UART console header this project had not found any evidence
of previously (the official recovery PDF's own board photos don't show it - this is presumably an
undocumented engineering test point, not something Creality expects end users to use). Wiring
guidance given: adapter GND/RX to board GND/TX (cross them, never TX-to-TX), 115200 8N1, no power
line connected.

**The boot+reset button combo and USB recovery path - now verified on real hardware, not just
documentation.** First attempt showed zero USB activity at all (checked via `lsusb`, raw
`/sys/bus/usb/devices`, and `journalctl -k` - nothing, not even a failed enumeration), in both normal
boot and after the button sequence - strong evidence of a charge-only MicroUSB cable, exactly the
failure mode the official PDF itself warns about. After swapping cables/retrying, `lsusb` showed
`a108:eaef Ingenic Semiconductor Co.,Ltd Ingenic USB BOOT DEVICE` - the exact VID:PID and device
string this track predicted from the X2000 boot ROM chapter and the PDF's own Device Manager
screenshot, months of documentation-based confidence now backed by a real device actually entering
mask-ROM recovery mode.

**The dry-run read (`ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot --dump-partition`) worked, but not as expected - and
found a real bug in this project's own partition-offset math.** Verified from source, line by line,
before running anything: `--uboot` only loads code into volatile RAM (`0xb2401000`/`0x80100000`,
confirmed via `run_stage1`/`run_stage2`/`start_x2000_uboot`) and `--dump-partition`
(`mmc_read_partition()`) only calls `mmc_read()` then writes to a **local** file - the codebase's
separate `mmc_write()` is never invoked by this path. Confirmed safe before running.

The command was meant to read `sn_mac` at offset `0x100000` (computed by summing partition sizes
from 0) but returned `ota:kernel\n\n` + zero padding instead - **byte-for-byte identical** to the
`ota` partition's content pulled from the live device over SSH weeks earlier (§19). Root cause: a
real, previously undocumented `uboot` region occupies raw offset `0x0`-`0x100000`, *before* `ota`
begins - `ota`'s true offset is `0x100000` (matching `ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`'s own hardcoded
`mmc_read(0x100000, ...)` in `swap_ota_partition()`, which was correct all along). Every offset this
project computed by naively summing partition sizes from 0 was off by exactly one 1 MiB slot - the
same class of manual-arithmetic mistake as this session's earlier Kconfig-duplicate-line and
wrong-DTS-file errors, just in a new form.

**Real impact assessed - deliberately not "fixed" by hand-recomputing nine more offsets**: none of
this project's actual committed recovery infrastructure (`flash-spare-slot.sh`,
`ota_marker.sh`/`S00revert-safety`/`S99confirm-good`) uses raw byte offsets at all - all of it
addresses partitions via `/dev/mmcblk0pN` device nodes or `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/` symlinks, resolved
by the live kernel's own GPT parsing, completely unaffected by this mistake. The error only lived in
one ad-hoc manual command. Given hand-arithmetic is the demonstrated root cause, the right fix isn't
retyping eight more corrected numbers - it's a standing rule: **any future raw-offset command must be
derived by reading the device's own GPT bytes directly and parsing them programmatically** (the same
approach already used successfully for the device-tree pull in §19), never by hand-summing a
documented size table.

**Net result**: the dry run's actual purpose - proving the USB/mask-ROM recovery path can
communicate with and correctly read data from this specific physical unit, not just enter download
mode - is fully achieved, and more convincingly than a routine `sn_mac` read would have been: an
independent, byte-for-byte cross-validation against previously-verified known-good data, via a
completely different access path (raw USB, no OS involved at all) than the one used to originally
capture that reference data (SSH through the running OS). This closes the one remaining physical
unknown flagged in §23/§24 as unresolvable by investigation alone.

**Real hardware limit found - the recovery protocol cannot address the whole device.** Following up
on "could we back up everything", checked the wire protocol's own `ReadCmd`/`WriteCmd` structs
(`offset`/`length` fields are both plain `uint32_t`) and confirmed the units are raw bytes, not
sectors (the working `ota` read used byte offset `0x100000` directly). **This is a hard 4 GiB ceiling
built into the actual USB recovery protocol itself, not a tool limitation** - nothing at or beyond
offset `0x100000000` is reachable this way, on any tool, ever. This device's eMMC is 7.28 GiB total
(`7636800 * 1024` bytes, from `/proc/partitions`), so roughly the last 3.28 GiB is permanently out of
reach of this recovery path. Mapped out where that boundary actually falls: every system-critical
partition (`uboot` through `rootfs_data`) sits within the first ~1.30 GiB - fully reachable. Only
`userdata` (the user's own gcode/print files, starting at ~1.30 GiB and extending to the end of the
device) crosses the wall - about the last 3.28 GiB of it is unreachable via this tool. User
confirmed userdata isn't a concern for this track's purposes (real user files, unrelated to system
recoverability) - if it's ever wanted, plain SSH+`dd` from the running stock OS has no such limit and
already works (used for the `kernel2`/`rootfs2` backup in §19).

**A real, complete, verified backup of every system-critical partition now exists.** Backed up the
first 1.5 GiB (`0x60000000` bytes from offset 0 - comfortable margin past `rootfs_data`'s real end,
deliberately not attempting to capture userdata) via
`ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot --dump-partition`. Verified byte-for-byte against known expectations at
every partition boundary, not just trusted the file size: `uboot` (real header), `ota`
(`ota:kernel\n\n`, exact match to every prior read of this partition), `sn_mac` (**real data read for
the first time this whole project** - two MAC-address-shaped strings plus `F005`, matching the board
name already known from `/etc/ota_info` - genuine per-unit provisioning data), `rtos`/`rtos2`
(identical real RTOS firmware in both slots), `kernel`/`kernel2` (both valid `uImage` magic), and
`rootfs` (valid squashfs magic). Every single check passed - a complete, real, independently-verified
recovery point, kept at `vendor/device-backups/nebula_system_backup.bin` (gitignored - proprietary
firmware plus this unit's own real MAC addresses, never committed, same principle as every other
device-derived artifact this project has produced).

**Honest state of the "flash back" half**: this backup can be *read* right now, verified as
complete and correct - but the tool has no ready-made "write this file back to this raw offset"
command. `mmc_write()` exists and is proven (it's exactly what `swap_ota_partition()` already uses),
but nothing exposes it generically the way `--dump-partition` exposes `mmc_read()`. Building and
carefully reviewing that addition - mirroring `mmc_read_partition()`'s exact chunking approach - is
real, deliberate, not-yet-done follow-up work before "restore from this backup" is actually a button
we can press, rather than just a real capability we've confirmed the pieces exist for.

## 26. Write capability built and proven, then the actual boot test - a real failure, and a real, complete recovery

**Built and verified the missing write half.** Added `mmc_write_partition()`/`--write-partition` to
`ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`, mirroring `mmc_read_partition()`'s exact chunking (same 2MB chunk size)
but adding what a write needs that a read never did: an immediate read-back verification of every
single chunk right after writing it, refusing to proceed past the first mismatch rather than writing
the rest blind. Reviewed line-by-line before running anything. Tested with a real, deliberately
low-stakes round trip on actual hardware: wrote a distinctive test pattern to 512 bytes of confirmed-
unused zero-padding inside the `ota` partition (fully covered by the existing backup), read it back
independently to confirm it landed, then wrote the original zero bytes back and read back again to
confirm an exact restore. All four steps passed. This closes the gap flagged just above - reading
and writing are now both real and proven on this exact device, not just built. Saved as
`patches/ingenic-usbboot-write-partition.patch` (our own diff only, not the base tool - same
no-upstream-license reasoning as §23: clone `ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot` fresh, `git apply` this
patch, then `make`).

**Then did the actual boot test - the real point of everything this whole track has built toward.**
Wrote the freshly-rebuilt `uImage`/`rootfs.squashfs` (containing every fix from today: uart4 console,
revert-first init, tmpfs writable storage, GuppyScreen WiFi panel deps) to the spare slot via
`flash-spare-slot.sh` - both writes verified via md5 exactly as designed. Flipped the `ota` marker to
`ota:kernel2` (confirmed correct byte format via read-back: `ota:kernel2\n\n` + zero padding) and
issued a soft `reboot` from the still-running stock OS. Proceeded deliberately without the serial
console connected - a real, explicit tradeoff discussed and agreed beforehand: mask-ROM recovery was
already proven, so the worst case was covered, at the cost of losing diagnostic detail if the
attempt only partially failed.

**Result: a real, early failure.** The display showed a static logo (almost certainly U-Boot's own
splash - this build has no Creality-branded assets anywhere, so what was showing could not have come
from anything we built) that never progressed for several minutes, and no network activity at all
came up (checked both automatically and by the user directly, including the wired `ax88179` path).
No serial console means the exact failure point can't be pinned down from this attempt alone - it's
consistent with U-Boot failing to successfully load/jump to the custom `kernel2` image, or the kernel
crashing very early, before ever reaching a point where networking or the framebuffer would come up.
This is real, useful information despite the lack of detail: **the custom kernel/rootfs did not boot
successfully on the first real attempt.**

**Then did the actual recovery - for real, not a drill.** Since nothing ever reached userspace,
`S00revert-safety` never got a chance to run, meaning the `ota` marker was still pointing at
`kernel2` - a plain reboot would have just retried the same failed boot. Re-entered USB download mode
(boot+reset buttons, confirmed via `lsusb` showing `a108:eaef` again), used `--force-swap-ota` to
write `ota:kernel` back unconditionally, verified via a fresh `--dump-partition` read that it now
reads exactly `ota:kernel\n\n` (matching the original value byte-for-byte), then had the user reset
the device to exit download mode and do a real boot. **Confirmed fully recovered**: network
reachable, Moonraker responding normally (`print_stats: standby`), and - the clean, authoritative
proof - `/proc/cmdline` shows `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7`, the original stock slot. Zero reliance on
anything the failed attempt might have touched; recovery went entirely through the mask-ROM path that
was built and tested earlier in this same session.

**Why this matters beyond just "it didn't work yet"**: this is the first genuine, real-world
end-to-end proof of the entire recovery chain this track has been building - not a controlled test on
inert padding bytes, an actual real failure followed by an actual real recovery, using exactly the
tools and procedures documented here, with no surprises and no need for anything beyond what was
already built. The boot failure itself is a real, unresolved problem - but the ability to fail safely
and recover completely, which was the harder and more important thing to get right first, held up
completely under real conditions.

**Next real step, and it's now unambiguous**: serial console is no longer optional for another
attempt - without it, this exact failure mode (static splash, no network) gives no way to
distinguish "U-Boot never loaded the kernel" from "the kernel crashed in the first few milliseconds"
from any number of other early-boot failure causes. The `J1: GND RX TX` header found in §25 is
sitting there, physically present, unused so far - wiring it up before the next attempt is the
difference between another blind guess and an actual diagnosis.

## 27. Serial console wired up and proven - a real reference boot log captured, and a real voltage bug fixed along the way

**A real hardware-safety question led to a real bug fix before anything was ever connected.**
Checking what voltage to use for `J1` (an FTDI232 adapter, 3.3V vs 5V) turned up a genuine
discrepancy: this project's own custom kernel DTS had Port A (the bank `J1`'s pins live on) set to
`GPIO_VOLTAGE_1V8`, but the real device's own live device tree (pulled via `/sys/firmware/fdt` back
in §19) shows the actual hardware runs Port A at `GPIO_VOLTAGE_3V3` (raw value `0x02`, decoded
against the real enum in `ingenic-gpio.h` - not assumed). Fixed in
`module_drivers/dts/x2000/halley5_v30.dts`, patch regenerated and reverified against the pristine
base commit. This may or may not have contributed to §26's boot failure, but it was simply wrong for
the real hardware regardless and needed fixing.

**First serial attempt: nothing, even on a confirmed-working reboot.** Wired an FTDI232 to `J1`
(detected instantly on this workstation as a real `0403:6001` FT232 device at `/dev/ttyUSB0`),
configured 115200 8N1, and captured while rebooting the currently-stock device (known to boot
successfully - this was deliberately used as a wiring test before ever trying it against anything
uncertain). Zero bytes captured. Diagnosed correctly from first principles rather than guessed at
random: zero data (not garbled data) on a *known-good* boot points at the wiring, not voltage - most
likely RX/TX connected straight instead of crossed, since that leaves both ends listening with
nothing actually driving the line.

**After crossing RX/TX: complete success.** Captured a full 506-line boot log of the real stock
4.4.94 kernel, saved permanently at `vendor/device-backups/stock-boot-reference-log.txt` (gitignored
- the log itself is fine to keep, but it's a real capture of proprietary boot output, same handling
as everything else device-derived). This is now a genuine reference baseline this project never had
before, and it's rich with real, useful confirmation:

- `U-Boot SPL 2013.07 (Oct 09 2023 - 16:41:52)` - the real, exact U-Boot version, printed live for
  the first time (previously only inferred from `ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`'s own bundled boot log
  screenshot).
- `vendonvram sn: ... nvram mac: FCEE11004C14 ... nvram model: F005` - U-Boot itself printing the
  exact same `sn_mac` partition data independently pulled via the mask-ROM path in §25 (real
  cross-validation, two completely different access methods agreeing).
- `Uncompressing Linux...` / `Ok, booting the kernel.` immediately followed by
  `Linux version 4.4.94 ...` - the precise checkpoint that separates "U-Boot successfully found and
  jumped to the kernel image" from "it never got that far." This is exactly the missing piece from
  §26 - the next attempt at the custom kernel will show either this same sequence (meaning the
  failure is in our own kernel's early boot, past U-Boot's hand-off) or nothing at all past the SPL
  banner (meaning U-Boot itself never successfully loaded/jumped to `kernel2`).
- A benign `CPU0 RESET ERROR PC:8001E084` message appears even on this fully successful boot -
  confirmed non-fatal noise, not a real problem, worth knowing so the same message on the next
  attempt isn't mistaken for the actual cause of failure.

**Net effect**: the next custom-kernel boot attempt will, for the first time, have real diagnostic
visibility rather than a blind static-screen guess - and the wiring, voltage, and capture setup have
already been proven correct against a real, known-good boot, rather than being untested variables on
top of an already-uncertain custom kernel.

## 28. The checked-in build pipeline itself fixed, not just today's rebuild - two more real Buildroot staleness bugs found

Before rebuilding with the `gpa_voltage` fix, adapted `scripts/build/02/03/05/06` so the *pipeline
itself* is correct and reproducible, not just this one rebuild done by hand again.

**`02-configure-buildroot.sh` had a real idempotency bug**: it did plain host-user `cp`/`rm` into
`vendor/buildroot-x2000/`, but after any `docker --user root` build runs (every build), that tree
becomes root-owned - so any re-run failed with `Permission denied`, exactly what happened earlier
this session. Fixed by moving all the file operations inside a root container too, not just the
`make olddefconfig` step.

**`03-build-kernel-and-rootfs.sh` and `05-final-build.sh` both just ran plain `make`** - the exact
gap that caused §24's silent stale-overlay rebuild. Added `make linux-dirclean` before `make` in 03,
guaranteeing kernel source changes are always picked up rather than trusting Buildroot's own (correctly
documented as unreliable for `LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR`) staleness detection.

**A second, real instance of the same underlying class of bug turned up immediately during today's
actual rebuild - for a different package.** After running the adapted pipeline, `06-verify.sh`
reported `wpa_cli` missing, even though the top-level `.config` clearly had
`BR2_PACKAGE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_CLI=y`. Root cause: Buildroot does not automatically rebuild an
already-built *package* just because its own Kconfig options changed after that package was already
built once (a general, documented Buildroot limitation, not specific to `LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR`) -
`wpa_supplicant` had been built once before with `CTRL_IFACE`/`CLI` disabled, and a later plain
`make` silently kept shipping that old build even after the `.config` was fixed. Confirmed directly
(not assumed): `wpa_supplicant`'s own generated `.config` and `output/target/usr/sbin/wpa_cli`'s
absence both pointed the same way. Fixed the same way as the kernel - `make wpa_supplicant-dirclean`
before `make` - and added this permanently to `03-build-kernel-and-rootfs.sh`, with a clear comment
flagging this as a *general* Buildroot gotcha (any package whose Kconfig options get changed after
first being built needs the same treatment), not a one-off.

**Along the way, a third "MISS" turned out to be a bug in the verification itself, not the build** -
`06-verify.sh`'s own new check used `/usr/bin/wpa_cli`, but the real, correct install path (confirmed
via `find` in the actual build tree) is `/usr/sbin/wpa_cli`, matching `dropbear`'s own convention.
Fixed the check, not the (already-correct) build - a good reminder to verify which side of a failing
check is actually wrong before assuming the build regressed.

**Also fixed while touching these scripts**: `05-final-build.sh` never copied `rootfs.squashfs` at
all - the actual image format used for real flashing (`flash-spare-slot.sh` targets squashfs,
matching the real device's own partition format) - only `rootfs.ext2`. Added. Also replaced a
hardcoded `chown 1000:1000` with `$(id -u):$(id -g)` computed at run time, so the script stays
correct for any user, not just this one.

**A known, separate, not-yet-fixed issue flagged rather than scope-crept into**: `04-cross-compile-
app-stack.sh` has an inconsistent mix of `docker run` calls, some with `--user root` and some
without - a real, similar class of risk to what was just fixed in 02, but out of scope for today
since nothing in this session touched the app-stack cross-compile step.

Final rebuild, this time via the actually-adapted scripts end to end (02 → 03 → 05 → 06), passed
every single check in `06-verify.sh` - including all of today's new files and the corrected
`wpa_cli` path. Artifacts in `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` now genuinely reflect the
`gpa_voltage` fix, ready for the next real boot attempt.

## 29. Root cause of the §26 boot failure found and fixed - a gzip-vs-uncompressed mismatch, and it took two separate fixes to actually stick

**The reference boot log from §27 pinpointed the exact failure point.** Comparing the two uImage
headers directly (`struct.unpack('>IIIIIIIBBBB', ...)` against the first 32 bytes) showed our
custom kernel was gzip-compressed (`compression=1`) while both real stock `kernel`/`kernel2`
partitions are uncompressed (`compression=0`). That matches the actual failure symptom precisely:
the stock reference log prints `Uncompressing Linux...` immediately before `Linux version
4.4.94 ...`, and the custom-kernel attempt in §26 never printed that line at all - SPL ran
identically to a known-good boot right up through DDR init/RTOS/nvram read, then simply stopped.
The most likely explanation: this board's SPL is a minimal bootstrap stage with no gunzip support,
so it silently hangs the moment it tries to decompress a gzip-compressed image.

**First fix attempt didn't work, and *looked* like it should have.** Added `CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=y` to
`halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config` - MIPS's own `arch/mips/boot/Makefile` only maps
`CONFIG_KERNEL_{GZIP,BZIP2,LZMA,LZO}` to a compressed uImage suffix, so selecting XZ (a mandatory
Kconfig choice, satisfying the kernel's "must pick exactly one" requirement) falls through to the
same uncompressed `.bin` the stock kernel uses, without needing the generic, MIPS-unavailable
`KERNEL_UNCOMPRESSED` option. Rebuilt, decoded the new header - still `compression=1`. Not a
tooling mistake this time; a real, two-layer Kconfig gap:

1. **`arch/mips/Kconfig`'s `config MACH_XBURST2` block only ever `select`s `HAVE_KERNEL_GZIP`**,
   never `HAVE_KERNEL_XZ`. `CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ`'s own `depends on HAVE_KERNEL_XZ` could therefore
   never be satisfied for this board, so every `make olddefconfig` pass silently dropped the
   fragment's `CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=y` line and fell back to the choice's default (`KERNEL_GZIP`) -
   confirmed directly with an isolated `merge_config.sh` + `olddefconfig` test against the real
   kernel source, outside the full Buildroot pipeline, to rule out a Buildroot-specific cause
   before assuming one. Fixed with `select HAVE_KERNEL_XZ` added right next to the existing
   `HAVE_KERNEL_GZIP` line - a real kernel-source patch, not a config-fragment one.
2. **Even with (1) fixed, the choice still resolved to GZIP** - a second, independent mechanism.
   Buildroot has its *own* top-level "Kernel compression format" choice
   (`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_GZIP`/`_XZ`/... in `linux/Config.in`), completely separate from the kernel's
   own `CONFIG_KERNEL_*` symbols, and it force-overrides whatever the kernel's `.config`/fragment
   says on *every* build via `LINUX_KCONFIG_FIXUP_CMDS`'s
   `KCONFIG_ENABLE_OPT($(LINUX_COMPRESSION_OPT_y))` (`linux/linux.mk:388`) - traced by reading that
   fixup step directly after noticing the real build log showed the fragment merge succeeding
   (`Value of CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ is redefined ... New value: CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=y`) and an
   intermediate `oldconfig` pass correctly resolving to XZ, only for a *later*, separate
   "Updating kernel config with fixups" step to silently flip it straight back to GZIP with no
   warning at all. Fixed by setting `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_XZ=y` (and un-setting `_GZIP`) in the
   top-level `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/buildroot.config` - the file that actually
   determines the final compression choice, independent of the kernel-side fragment.

Both fixes were verified in isolation before the real rebuild: a throwaway `merge_config.sh` +
`olddefconfig` test confirmed fix (1) alone resolves the *kernel's own* choice correctly
(`CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=y`, `CONFIG_KERNEL_GZIP` unset), and the real build log after fix (2) showed the
kernel's build-tree `.config` correctly landing on `# CONFIG_KERNEL_GZIP is not set` /
`CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ=y` with no further overrides.

**Final rebuild confirms the fix.** Decoded the resulting `uImage` header:
`compression=0`, size grew from 6,386,343 bytes (gzip) to 14,457,328 bytes (raw) - exactly the
direction and rough magnitude expected for dropping compression on a ~14MB kernel.
`06-verify.sh` still passes every check clean.

**One remaining discrepancy was checked and is not a bug.** The new header's entry point
(`0x80a4ae1c`) still doesn't equal its load address (`0x80010000`), unlike stock's uncompressed
image where load and entry are identical. Confirmed via `readelf -h` against the actual built
`vmlinux` that `0x80a4ae1c` is genuinely that binary's own ELF entry point (the `kernel_entry`
symbol, placed wherever the linker script put it) - not a stray or miscomputed value. This is
expected, not a regression: a *compressed* uImage's entry point points at a small decompressor stub
at the very front of the image (hence `ep == load`), while an *uncompressed* image's entry point is
simply wherever the real kernel entry symbol lives in the linked binary, which is naturally offset
from the start of the raw image. Nothing about this needs fixing.

**Still not tested against real hardware.** The device has been unreachable (100% packet loss)
since the §26 attempt and stays that way until the physical recovery button sequence is pressed
again - per the explicit agreement for this session, no further live write/flip/reboot attempt runs
without the user physically present. What's ready for that next attempt: a rebuilt, verified
`uImage`/`rootfs.ext2`/`rootfs.squashfs` with the compression mismatch closed, plus a serial console
already proven end-to-end against a real known-good boot (§27), so this next attempt - unlike §26 -
will have full boot-log visibility from the very first byte U-Boot prints.

## 30. A real spare-slot recovery detour, a stale-assumption dead end, and a second real blocker (uncompressed image too big) found and fixed

**Real hardware recovery, with a real detour.** Attempted the actual boot test from §29's fix. It
failed differently (hung again, no network) - with the user present and the serial console already
wired, restored the spare `kernel2`/`rootfs2` slot byte-for-byte from the full system backup via
`ingenic-usbboot`'s write-partition path, hardened along the way against real, repeated
`LIBUSB_ERROR_TIMEOUT`/`LIBUSB_ERROR_PIPE` failures hit during sustained multi-chunk writes (retry-
with-backoff added to both control-transfer code paths - `patches/ingenic-usbboot-write-partition.patch`).
This was real, useful hardening, but it turned out to be solving the wrong problem: early in this
session, confirmed the OTA marker read `ota:kernel` (stock), then reasoned from that fact for a long
stretch without ever re-checking it. A fresh re-check (only after repeated pushback) showed it
actually read `ota:kernel2` - it had flipped back, unnoticed, at some point. The device's real A/B
logic (confirmed via strings/hex inspection of the `uboot` region itself: a plain `strncmp` against
a literal `"ota:kernel2"` string, default-else-`kernel`) was correct and simple the whole time -
nothing was wrong with the mechanism, only with a stale assumption about the marker's current value.
Flipping it back and rebooting worked immediately: a full, healthy 217-line stock boot log captured,
network confirmed up. See [[feedback_check_print_before_restart]] in the durable memory record - this
became a generalized standing rule from this incident, not just a one-off note.

**A second, real, previously-hidden blocker, found by actually checking instead of assuming
readiness.** Asked whether the fixed build could finally be tested - before answering yes, checked
the built `uImage`'s actual size against the real partition capacity: **14,457,392 bytes**, against
`kernel2`'s fixed **8,388,608-byte** capacity. The uncompressed kernel doesn't fit at all - `flash-
spare-slot.sh`'s own size check would correctly refuse to write it. This was invisible while gzip-
compressed (6.4MB, fit fine) and only became visible once §29 turned compression off entirely.

**Fix: switch from the XZ-as-uncompressed trick to real LZO compression.** LZO *is* one of the
formats `arch/mips/boot/Makefile`'s `suffix-y` logic specially handles (produces a genuinely
compressed `.lzo` uImage, unlike XZ's deliberate uncompressed fallthrough), and LZO's much simpler
algorithm (vs. gzip's DEFLATE) makes it plausible this board's minimal SPL supports it even though it
apparently doesn't support gzip - a real, untested-until-tried hypothesis, not a certainty. Needed
the same kind of kernel-source fix as XZ did: `arch/mips/Kconfig`'s `MACH_XBURST2` block only ever
selected `HAVE_KERNEL_GZIP`/`HAVE_KERNEL_XZ` (from the §29 fix) - added `select HAVE_KERNEL_LZO`
alongside them. Set `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LZO=y` (replacing `_XZ`) in the top-level `buildroot.config`,
and `CONFIG_KERNEL_LZO=y` in the kernel fragment file.

**Rebuilt and verified.** Kernel `.config` correctly shows `CONFIG_KERNEL_LZO=y`,
`CONFIG_KERNEL_GZIP` unset. Decoded the new `uImage` header: `compression=4` (LZO, matching
U-Boot's standard `IH_COMP_LZO` enum value), size **7,034,435 bytes** - comfortably under the 8MB
partition capacity. `06-verify.sh` passes every check clean.

**Still genuinely unknown**: whether this SPL actually supports LZO decompression at all - that's
the real, open question for the next boot attempt, not yet tested against real hardware.

## 31. REAL BOOT SUCCESS - the custom kernel actually boots. Wrong image format the whole time, not a compression problem at all

**LZO failed identically to gzip on real hardware** - both hung at the exact same point (right after
nvram, zero further output, no "Uncompressing Linux..." line at all). Two different compression
formats producing an identical silent hang was the real signal this was never actually about
compression *support* - both rely on U-Boot's own generic decompression logic understanding the
uImage header's `comp` field, and apparently neither format is understood by it.

**The real mechanism, found by actually reading this vendor SDK's own custom build system rather
than assuming mainline Linux's.** `arch/mips/boot/zcompressed/Makefile` (a completely separate,
vendor-specific build path this project had never looked at before) defines three distinct kernel
image targets:
- `uImage` - what Buildroot has been building this whole time: raw `vmlinux.bin`, gzip'd, loaded at
  `CONFIG_LOADADDR` (`0x80010000`).
- `zImage` - a **self-decompressing** binary: the vendor's own `head.S`/`misc.o` bootstrap stub is
  compiled in alongside an internally-gzip'd `vmlinux.bin.gz` payload, so the binary decompresses
  *itself* once executed - no dependency on U-Boot/SPL understanding any compression at all.
- `xImage` - takes that self-decompressing `zImage` and wraps it in an mkimage header with
  `-C none`, loaded **and entered** at `CONFIG_XIMAGE_LDADDR` (`0x80F00000` - the exact real load
  address stock's own kernel/kernel2 partitions use).

`arch/mips/Makefile:481` documents this literally: `'xImage - U-Boot-spl xImage (ingenic spl boot)'`.
This is the actual, real, intended format for this board's SPL - not a plain uncompressed
`vmlinux.bin`, and not a standard mainline-style compressed uImage. Explains every single silent
hang this whole investigation hit: U-Boot/SPL was never being asked to decompress our images
because that was never the mechanism at all - it just loads raw bytes and jumps, and the *jumped-to
code* (present in a real xImage, absent from anything built via the standard `uImage` target) does
the actual self-decompression.

**Fix**: switched Buildroot's kernel image target from `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_UIMAGE` to
`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_IMAGE_TARGET_CUSTOM` with `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_IMAGE_TARGET_NAME="xImage"` and
`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_IMAGE_NAME="compressed/xImage"` (the real final path, confirmed by reading
`arch/mips/Makefile`'s own `xImage:` rule: it builds via the `zcompressed` subdir then copies the
result to `arch/mips/boot/compressed/xImage`). The generic "Kernel compression mode" Kconfig choice
(§29/§30's whole `CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ`/`_LZO` saga) turned out to be entirely irrelevant to this real
fix - `xImage` bypasses that mechanism completely, hardcoding its own internal gzip via the
`zcompressed` Makefile regardless of that setting. Renamed `05-final-build.sh`'s copied artifact
from `uImage` to `xImage` to match reality rather than continuing to call it the wrong thing.

**Rebuilt and decoded**: the new `xImage` header shows `load=0x80f00000`, `ep=0x80f00000` (`load==ep`,
matching stock exactly), `compression=0`, size 6,406,144 bytes (fits the 8MB partition easily).
`06-verify.sh` clean.

**Real, live test - with the user present, full recovery procedure re-confirmed working throughout**:
flashed the new `xImage`/`rootfs.squashfs` to the spare slot via `flash-spare-slot.sh` (from the
currently-booted stock OS, `print_stats` freshly checked idle first), flipped the ota marker to
`kernel2` using the device's *own* official mechanism (`. /etc/ota_bin/ota_utils.sh; . /etc/ota_bin/
ota_local_method.sh; local_set_next_boot_device` - confirmed via reading the real vendor script that
this does the exact same toggle our own recovery tool does), rebooted with serial capture active.

**Real result: it booted.** `Uncompressing Linux...` / `Ok, booting the kernel.` /
`Linux version 6.6.18-rt23 ... #2 SMP PREEMPT Mon Jul 20 21:35:44 UTC 2026` - our actual kernel,
our actual build, genuinely executing on real hardware for the first time this entire project.
`root=/dev/mmcblk0p8` confirms it's using the custom rootfs2, not stock. Progressed deep into normal
Linux init (WiFi driver probing, etc.) before getting stuck at `Waiting for root device
/dev/mmcblk0p8...` - a real, different, much narrower problem than anything hit before.

**New lead for next session, not yet investigated**: `msc1` (the WiFi SDIO controller, confirmed via
the DTS - has `mmc-pwrseq`/`bcmdhd_wlan` child node) fails with `Failed to initialize a non-removable
card`, but that exactly matches the already-known, harmless vendor `dhd` WiFi driver failure
(`[dhd] failed to power up DHD generic adapter, max retry reached`) seen right alongside it in the
same log - expected, unrelated to storage. `msc2` (the real eMMC, confirmed via DTS: `msc0` is
`status = "disable"`, `msc1` is WiFi, `msc2` is the only remaining candidate) registers its SDHCI
controller cleanly (`mmc2: SDHCI controller on ingenic-sdhci [13490000.msc] using ADMA`, no error) -
but no `mmcblk0:` card-attach success message ever appears in the log before boot gets stuck waiting
for it. `CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK`/`CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION`/`CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION` are all confirmed enabled
already, ruling out the obvious Kconfig-gap explanation. Real, scoped, well-defined next question:
why doesn't the eMMC card itself ever finish attaching on `msc2`, despite its controller registering
without error. Full boot log saved at
`vendor/device-backups/ximage-custom-kernel-boot-attempt.log`.

**Device safely recovered to stock afterward**, full recovery procedure (re-enter download mode,
fresh marker re-check, flip, reset) worked cleanly on the first try this time.

## 32. Three real bugs found and fixed by comparing against the real stock device's own live device tree - eMMC now mounts, only a late userspace crash remains

**Found by pulling and decoding the real, live stock device's actual `/sys/firmware/fdt`** (via
`scp` + `dtc`, run against the same `pellcorp/k1-bash-build` toolchain used throughout this project)
rather than continuing to guess from property patterns alone - directly answered the §31 eMMC
question and turned up two more real gaps along the way.

**Bug 1 (the real §31 blocker): `msc0`, not `msc2`, is the real eMMC - and it was disabled.**
Stock's own DTB shows `msc@0x13450000` (`msc0`) with `status = "okay"`, `non-removable`,
`bus-width = <8>`, `mmc-hs200-1_8v`, `max-frequency = 100MHz` - a real, live, enabled eMMC
controller. `msc1` (WiFi/SDIO) and `msc2` (SD card slot - confirmed by its own real properties:
`cd-gpio`, `wp-gpio`, `sd-uhs-sdr104`, none of which apply to soldered-on eMMC) are both `disabled`
on stock. Our own board file had this backwards: `msc0` was disabled (as a stale 4-bit template with
no pinctrl at all), while `msc2` (the SD slot) was left enabled - explaining exactly why §31 got a
clean SDHCI controller registration with no card ever attaching: the real storage was never even
probed. Fixed: enabled `msc0` with the real stock values (8-bit, `mmc-hs200-1_8v`, 100MHz,
`non-removable`), and added `pinctrl-0 = <&msc0_8bit>` (resolved from stock's own pinctrl phandle -
this group already existed, unused, in the shared `x2000-pinctrl.dtsi`, and another in-tree
reference board, `zebra.dts`, already demonstrates the identical wiring pattern).

**Bug 2, found the same way: `i2c4` (the touch controller's bus) was also missing its pinctrl.**
Same root cause as `msc0` - our own `&i2c4` override sets `status = "okay"` but never sets
`pinctrl-0`, and the base `x2000.dtsi` doesn't supply one either. Stock's live DTB shows a real
`pinctrl-0` referencing an `"i2c4-pc"` group - which, again, already existed unused in
`x2000-pinctrl.dtsi` as `i2c4_pc`. Fixed by adding the same reference. Real risk this posed: without
correct pinmux, the I2C bus may not actually be electrically connected to the physical pins at all,
which would have surfaced as a silent touch failure much later, easy to misdiagnose as a driver or
hardware problem instead of a devicetree gap.

**Important caveat surfaced while doing this comparison, worth recording**: this technique is only
valid where stock and our kernel use the *same* devicetree-driven mechanism for a peripheral.
`msc1` (WiFi) and `dtrng` (RNG) both show `disabled` on stock's own DTB too - yet both demonstrably
work on the real device. That's because stock's 4.4.94 kernel enables them via board-file C code
(`platform_device` registration), invisible in the compiled DTB, while our 6.6 kernel is fully
devicetree-driven for the same hardware. Blindly "matching stock's status flags" across the board
would have been actively wrong for those two. The comparison was only directly trustworthy for
`msc0`/`i2c4` because MMC/SDHCI and I2C are genuinely devicetree-native on both kernels.

**Tested for real, twice, with the user present.** First test (msc0 + i2c4 fixes only): real,
significant progress - `mmcblk0: mmc0:0001 DG4008 7.28 GiB` and all 10 partitions correctly
enumerated (confirms the eMMC fix worked completely) - but hit a new failure:
`VFS: Cannot open root device "/dev/mmcblk0p8" ... error -19`, followed by `Kernel panic - not
syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs`. Root-caused immediately: `# CONFIG_SQUASHFS is not set` in
our kernel `.config` - Buildroot's `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_SQUASHFS` only controls how the *rootfs image*
gets built, it does not touch the kernel's own filesystem driver support at all, so despite every
rootfs image this whole project has ever produced being squashfs, the kernel had zero squashfs
support compiled in. Fixed with `CONFIG_SQUASHFS=y` in the fragment file.

**Second test (all three fixes): real further progress.** `Uncompressing Linux...` /
`mmc0: new HS200 MMC card` / partitions enumerated / **`Run /linuxrc as init process`** - root
mounted successfully this time, real confirmation the squashfs fix worked. Then, with no visible
panic message at all, the log goes straight to a fresh SPL banner - `/linuxrc` (init) crashed or
rebooted almost immediately, before printing anything else. Genuinely not yet diagnosed - could be a
missing shared library, an exec permission issue, or something in our own `S00revert-safety`/
`S01tmpfs-datastore` early init scripts; deliberately not guessed further this session given the
late hour.

Full boot logs saved: `vendor/device-backups/msc0-i2c4-fix-boot-attempt.log` (first test),
`vendor/device-backups/squashfs-fix-boot-attempt.log` (second test, the current best result).

**Net state**: three real, confirmed bugs fixed this session (compression/image-format from §31,
eMMC + touch-pinctrl + squashfs from this section) - each found by direct comparison against real
hardware or real vendor build-system source, none guessed. Boot now gets further than ever before:
kernel loads, decompresses, mounts real root filesystem, hands off to init. The remaining problem is
narrower than everything before it - an early userspace crash, not a kernel/hardware issue. Device
safely back on stock.

## 33. The init crash traced to a real, well-understood cause - kernel module-loading exhaustion, not a mystery hardware reset

**First real lead: comparing against our own earlier panic behavior.** `CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT=10` is
set, and a genuine software `panic()` earlier this session (§32's `VFS: Unable to mount root fs`)
printed its message clearly and waited the full 10 seconds before rebooting, exactly as configured.
The §32 `/linuxrc` crash showed neither - zero text, zero delay, straight to a fresh SPL banner. That
comparison is conclusive: a real `panic()` call always goes through the same code path and would
print *something*; this didn't, meaning it never went through the kernel's own panic handling at
all - a genuine hardware-level reset, not a software crash.

**First real fix attempt: explicitly disable the watchdog at driver-probe time.** This board's stock
firmware runs `soc_watchdog` (confirmed via `lsmod`), and our own `ingenic_wdt.c` driver never
touches the hardware enable bit unless something opens `/dev/watchdog` (nothing on our build does) -
if U-Boot/SPL ever left the counter running from an earlier stage, nothing in this kernel would ever
stop it. Added an unconditional `writeb(0x0, ...COUNTER_ENABLE)` at probe time - the earliest point
our kernel could possibly disarm it. **Tested for real: the reset still happened, but much later**
(~29s instead of ~14s) and the boot was clearly still bootlooping through the same driver-probe
sequence each cycle. Real, honest result: this delayed rather than fixed it, meaning the specific
`ingenic_wdt` peripheral probably isn't the actual culprit (kept the fix anyway - defensively
correct regardless of whether it's load-bearing, and free of downside).

**Direct hardware check, at the user's suggestion, rather than continuing to theorize**: read the
real watchdog counter-enable register directly on the live, healthy, currently-running stock device
via `devmem 0x10002004` - it reads `0x00000000` (not counting). Combined with stock's own 40+
`/etc/init.d/` scripts never once mentioning `watchdog`/`wdt`, and SPL being the *identical* binary
for both stock and custom boots - this meaningfully weakens the idea that SPL arms this specific
peripheral as a boot-failure safety net at all.

**The real, conclusive diagnostic: force `init=/bin/sh` via the kernel's own command line, bypassing
U-Boot entirely.** Traced the actual mechanism in `arch/mips/kernel/setup.c` before touching
anything: with `CONFIG_MIPS_CMDLINE_FROM_DTB=y` kept as-is (preserving the real, U-Boot-injected
console/mem/root/rootfstype values - confirmed the DTS's own compiled-in `bootargs` block is dead,
commented-out reference text, so U-Boot must be injecting the *real* command line into the runtime
DTB directly, a completely standard, common pattern), adding `CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y` +
`CONFIG_CMDLINE="init=/bin/sh"` gets unconditionally appended at the end whenever
`MIPS_CMDLINE_BUILTIN_EXTEND` is unset - and Linux's own `init=` parsing takes the last occurrence,
so this safely overrides only the init target.

**Real result: a genuine, informative kernel panic, first try.**
`Kernel panic - not syncing: Requested init /bin/sh failed (error -8)` - printed cleanly, with the
full 10-second delay, exactly as `CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT` dictates. Immediately before it:
`request_module: modprobe binfmt-464c cannot be processed, kmod busy with 50 threads for more than 5
seconds now`. This is the real root cause candidate, not a guess:

- `error -8` is `ENOEXEC`. The kernel's `search_binary_handler()` only falls through to
  `request_module("binfmt-%04x", ...)` as a last resort, when *every already-registered* format
  handler - including the built-in ELF one (`CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y`, confirmed already set, not a
  module) - fails to recognize the file.
- Directly inspected the actual `/bin/sh` binary from our built rootfs (`debugfs` extraction +
  `readelf`): a completely valid MIPS32r2 o32 ELF, `Type: DYN`, **no `PT_INTERP` segment at all** -
  a fully static executable needing no runtime dynamic linker. The file itself is not corrupt and
  not the problem.
- The real, load-bearing clue is `kmod busy with 50 threads` - a genuine kernel-reported count of
  concurrently outstanding module-load helper threads, all stuck, *at the exact moment* our own
  requested exec needed to also use that same infrastructure. This points at a real, mechanistic,
  fixable class of bug: many of this build's drivers are configured as loadable modules (`=m`) -
  touchscreen, display panel, WiFi, Bluetooth, RNG, USB-ethernet - and if enough of them attempt
  `request_module()`-based autoloading via device/hotplug matching right as the kernel finishes
  enumerating hardware, with no working `modprobe`/hotplug userspace daemon running yet (a genuine
  chicken-and-egg problem - that daemon itself needs `init` to have started successfully first),
  those requests can saturate the kernel's own limited kmod worker-thread pool and start blocking
  *any* further `request_module()`-dependent operation, including - as seen here - resolving how to
  execute a plain ELF binary that would otherwise load instantly.

**This closes out tonight's real, standing question**: the §32 silent instant-reset was never a
mysterious hardware fault. It's a genuine kernel module-loading exhaustion at the precise moment
init tries to start - our real `/linuxrc`/init almost certainly hits the identical `ENOEXEC`
failure, just via the kernel's default multi-candidate init search path (trying `/sbin/init`,
`/etc/init`, `/bin/init`, `/bin/sh` in sequence, all aliasing to the same busybox binary, all
failing the same way) rather than the single, explicit target this diagnostic forced - which is
also a very plausible reason the real failure produces no visible panic message at all: exhausting
every candidate before finally panicking with a *different* message (`No working init found.`)
could itself be starved of the same kmod thread pool needed to even get that far cleanly, or the
console output itself could be getting starved/delayed by the same thread exhaustion.

**Concrete, well-scoped next step, not yet attempted**: convert some or all of the currently-`=m`
drivers to built-in (`=y`) - touchscreen (`ns2009`), display panel, and RNG are small, single-purpose
drivers on a fixed-hardware embedded product with no real benefit to remaining loadable modules;
WiFi/Bluetooth/USB-ethernet could plausibly follow the same reasoning, or alternatively investigate
whether the kernel's own module-autoload matching can be tuned/delayed until after `modprobe`
userspace is actually available. Diagnostic `init=/bin/sh` override removed before committing -
purely temporary, not part of the real build.

Full boot log: `vendor/device-backups/init-bin-sh-diagnostic-boot-attempt.log`. Device safely
recovered to stock (`panic_timeout`'s own auto-reboot, no button-press needed this time - the
marker naturally stayed on `kernel2` since `S00revert-safety` never got a chance to run, requiring
one more manual mask-ROM recovery cycle to get back to `kernel`).

## 34. Applied the kmod-exhaustion fixes, but the test that would confirm them was compromised by a real process-hygiene bug

**Cross-referenced §33's finding against real compiled output before fixing anything.** Decoded our
own compiled devicetree blob (not just the source) and paired every enabled node's `compatible`
string against the actual kernel `.config` to check which had a real, compiled driver (built-in or
module) versus none at all. Several initially-suspicious candidates (a leftover `goodix,gt9xx` node,
`ovti,ov2735a`, `rohm,dh2228fv`, `ingenic,bt_power`) all turned out to have real, working, mostly
*already built-in* drivers - no single "dead node" explains the kmod pressure. The real, narrower
picture: only 20 total loadable (`=m`) modules exist in this config, and **10 of them are a broad
family of USB-Ethernet dongle drivers** (`AX8817X`, `CDC-ETHER`, `CDC-NCM`, `NET1080`, `CDC-SUBSET`,
`ZAURUS`, `RTL8153-ECM`, plus `PHYLINK`/`AX88796B_PHY`) pulled in wholesale by enabling
`USB_NET_DRIVERS`, none of which are our actual hardware (confirmed: `AX88179_178A`'s only real
dependency is `USB_USBNET` + auto-selected `CRC32`/`PHYLIB`, both static libraries, not separate
autoload targets). Real USB hotplug enumeration at boot (this device does have a physical USB
Ethernet adapter attached) could plausibly probe several of these overlapping candidates via
`request_module()` before landing on the right one.

**Fixed two things**: converted the three small, single-purpose `=m` drivers (`ns2009` touchscreen,
the display panel, `ingenic-rng`) to built-in (`=y`) - no real benefit to remaining loadable on fixed
hardware, only downside (autoload contention at the exact moment init tries to start). Explicitly
disabled the 10 redundant USB-net/PHY options, keeping only `USB_USBNET`+`USB_NET_AX88179_178A`.
Rebuilt: `xImage` grew only ~4KB (comfortably still under the 8MB partition), `rootfs.squashfs`
shrank ~94KB (fewer `.ko` files). `06-verify.sh` correctly shows the three converted drivers as
"MISS" as separate module files - expected, since they're compiled into the kernel binary now, not
a regression.

**Tested live - but the result is not trustworthy, and that's a real, separate finding worth
recording.** The device bootlooped audibly (repeated buzzer beeps, confirmed by the user) before
recovery. Investigating the captured serial log found it suspiciously short and missing the
expected repeated SPL banners for each loop cycle - checking running processes revealed **six
separate, un-killed `cat /dev/ttyUSB0` capture processes** had accumulated since roughly midnight,
one launched fresh for each of tonight's tests without ever stopping the previous one. Multiple
readers on the same tty device race for incoming bytes non-deterministically - this very plausibly
explains several instances of garbled/interleaved text seen in earlier logs tonight too, not just
this one. All six killed; a clean, single-reader capture is now in place for the next real test.

**Honest conclusion**: the kmod-exhaustion fixes are real, well-justified, and committed - but
whether they actually resolved the boot failure is genuinely unconfirmed, since the one live test
run against them had compromised data. This needs a fresh, clean test to actually know. Device
safely back on stock (confirmed via `/proc/cmdline` showing `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7`, kernel 4.4.94).

## 35. A second round of real hardware-vs-defconfig auditing (uncommitted until now), a static-binary isolation test, and the actual `exec.c` mechanism finally read

**This entire round happened after §34's commit and was never written up or committed** - caught
only because a later session found the working tree still dirty (`kernel.config`,
`halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`, rebuilt `xImage`/`rootfs.*` all modified, plus a new untracked
`scripts/build/diag_init.c`) with no matching commit or FIRMWARE.md entry. Recovered by reading the
uncommitted diff and the boot logs it referenced directly, in full, rather than trusting any prior
summary.

**Found via the same "audit vendor base defconfig against real hardware" technique as §34, taken
further**: the vendor `x2000_halley5_v30_linux_defconfig` ships **`CONFIG_BCMDHD=y` built-in** - a
proprietary Broadcom driver targeting the *reference board's* own WiFi module
(`fw_bcm43456c5_ag.bin`/`nvram_ap6256.txt`, a BCM43456/AP6256 chip), not our real, live-confirmed
chip (Cypress CYW43438). Being built-in, it initialized unconditionally and, per a real captured log
(`vendor/device-backups/wdt-fix-boot-attempt.log`), power-cycled `WL_REG_ON` in a tight retry loop
every ~2-3s fighting our own `brcmfmac` driver over the same SDIO/GPIO hardware - never intentional,
nobody had disabled it when brcmfmac was added. Disabled (`# CONFIG_BCMDHD is not set`).

**Same bug class, two more found**: `CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_GT9XX` (Goodix - not our hardware, our real
touch is NS2009, already correctly enabled; its I2C probe against a NOACK'ing address cost ~0.74s
per boot) and `CONFIG_HALLEY5_CAMERA_BOARD` (+ `RD_X2000_HALLEY5_CAMERA_4V3` + the `INGENIC_ISP_CAMERA_OV2735A`
sensor driver it selects) - a vendor reference camera daughterboard we don't have; our real camera is
a generic USB UVC webcam via ustreamer, not this native ISP/CIM/MSCaler pipeline. Its I2C probe cost
a full ~10s waiting out an ABRT_7B_ADDR_NOACK timeout - a real, measurable chunk of boot time. Both
disabled. Note: the board-gate alone did not cascade-clear `OV2735A` (verified against the actual
built `.config`, not assumed) - the vendor tree selects it from two overlapping Kconfig trees, so it
needed disabling directly.

**Built a static, dependency-free diagnostic init** (`scripts/build/diag_init.c` - raw syscalls only,
no libc stdio, no dynamic linker, no `PT_INTERP`) specifically to isolate whether busybox/dynamic
linking/squashfs reads were implicated in the §33 panic, built with Buildroot's own internal
toolchain to keep it a single-variable test against busybox's exact ABI.

**The result nobody synthesized until this session**: three follow-up boot tests today
(`custom-boot-bcmdhd-fix-20260721-140901.log`, `custom-boot-diag-init-20260721-143315.log`,
`custom-boot-brcmfmac-builtin-20260721-145547.log`) **all still hit the identical panic** -
`request_module: modprobe binfmt-464c cannot be processed, kmod busy with 50 threads for more than
5 seconds now` -> `Kernel panic - not syncing: Requested init ... failed (error -8)`. The diag_init
result is the important one: a trivial static binary with zero dependencies failed exactly the same
way (`Requested init /diag_init failed (error -8)`), which conclusively rules out busybox, dynamic
linking, and squashfs reads as the cause. None of today's fixes resolved the panic - they only
pushed it later (9.4s -> 20-25s), consistent with real boot-time work being removed but the
underlying trigger untouched.

**Read this kernel's actual `fs/exec.c` `search_binary_handler()` for the first time** (previously
only reasoned about generically from memory of mainline Linux). Confirmed: `request_module("binfmt-%04x", ...)`
only fires after *every* already-registered format handler - including the built-in ELF loader
(`CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y`, confirmed `bool`, not `tristate`, can never itself be `=m`) - has returned
`-ENOEXEC`. That means the kmod-exhaustion message is a *symptom*, not the root cause: something is
making the built-in ELF loader itself reject a trivially valid, correctly-built MIPS32/O32 static
ELF binary. This is a narrower and previously-unasked question.

**Read the `initcall_debug`+`loglevel=8` output already captured in the most recent log** (this
`CONFIG_CMDLINE` was set in today's uncommitted fragment-config diff specifically for this). Every
initcall before the panic completed cleanly with matched calling/returned pairs - the entire ~12s
silent gap (`[8.754] Run /linuxrc as init process` -> `[9.962] mmc1: Failed to initialize a
non-removable card` -> `[21.910]` kmod-busy message) happens entirely inside the `execve()` attempt
itself, after all kernel initcalls are done. Ruled out stale/missing modprobe dependency data as a
contributing cause: `/lib/modules/6.6.18-rt23/modules.dep`+`modules.alias` exist and are freshly
regenerated from today's build (15:09). The actual source of the 50 concurrent `request_module()`
callers remains unidentified - next step is source-level `printk` instrumentation in
`search_binary_handler()`/`__request_module()` (`kernel/kmod.c`) rather than further static reading,
since we have full source control over this vendor tree.

**Compared against the live stock device for the first time on this specific question**: stock's own
`dmesg` (kernel 4.4.94, been up hours) has **zero** `request_module`/`kmod`/`binfmt` lines at all -
completely clean, consistent with its `S11module_driver_default`-before-`S12udev` force-insmod
strategy (§ found earlier this session) never giving the kernel's autoload path a chance to fire in
the first place. Also confirmed the hardware constraint that makes this dangerous at all: **2 CPU
cores, ~197MB total RAM**. Fifty concurrent kernel threads is a 25x oversubscription on this specific
board - reinforcing that structurally avoiding the scenario (stock's approach) is the right target,
not just fixing whatever triggers it this one time.

**Also found and fixed in this same session (not yet tested)**: `CONFIG_STAGE_ZC50289HSHD02=y` was
still enabled - a *second*, wrong MIPI-DSI panel driver (Fitipower ZC50289HSHD02, a vendor reference
panel). Confirmed real and live, not inert: `halley5_v30.dts` conditionally includes a full DT node
for it (`#ifdef CONFIG_STAGE_ZC50289HSHD02` / `#include ".../HALLEY5_MIPI_LCD_ZC50289HSHD02.dtsi"`),
so with this symbol set the mipi-dsi driver has a real, matching node to probe against alongside our
actual plain-RGB panel (`rosetteos_panel`, unconditional, our own addition) - directly explaining a log
line (`registered panel driver(fitipower_zc50289hshd02-lcd) to mipi-dsi driver`) earlier mistaken for
serial-capture splice contamination in an older, genuinely-contaminated log. Same bug class as
BCMDHD/GT9XX/camera above, just missed in the first pass. Checked two other suspicious symbols
(`CONFIG_BCM_4345C5_RFKILL`, `CONFIG_INGENIC_MAC`) and confirmed both are structurally inert for this
board - no matching driver source file for the former, no DT node at all for the latter - so left
alone.

## 36. The real root cause found, for real this time: a MIPS NaN-encoding ABI mismatch rejects every ELF exec unconditionally - kmod exhaustion was never the actual bug

Added `printk` instrumentation directly to this kernel's own `search_binary_handler()` (`fs/exec.c`)
and `__request_module()` (`kernel/module/kmod.c`) - logging every module-load request (name/comm/pid)
and which format handler ran for every exec attempt with what result. Verified via
`LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR` (`scripts/build/02-configure-buildroot.sh`) that `vendor/x2000_kernel_6.6` is
genuinely the tree Buildroot compiles from, not a separate reference checkout - confirmed the
instrumentation strings landed in the built `vmlinux` before ever touching the device. Rebuilt
(also folding in the `CONFIG_STAGE_ZC50289HSHD02` disable from §35), flashed to the spare slot via
`flash-spare-slot.sh` (both writes md5-verified), flipped the `ota` marker using the device's own
real `local_set_next_boot_device()` (`/etc/ota_bin/ota_local_method.sh`) rather than hand-rolling the
write, and ran a single clean serial capture across the reboot.

**The real chain, read directly from the log, not inferred**:
```
search_binary_handler filename=/linuxrc handler=load_elf_binary retval=-8
search_binary_handler filename=/linuxrc ALL FORMATS EXHAUSTED, requesting binfmt-464c
__request_module ENTER name=binfmt-464c comm=swapper/0 pid=1
search_binary_handler filename=/sbin/modprobe handler=load_elf_binary retval=-8
search_binary_handler filename=/sbin/modprobe ALL FORMATS EXHAUSTED, requesting binfmt-464c
__request_module ENTER name=binfmt-464c comm=kworker/u5:0 pid=505
... (repeats ~150 times across ~50 concurrent kworkers)
Kernel panic - not syncing: Requested init /linuxrc failed (error -8).
```
**This is a self-amplifying recursive storm, not 50 independent driver autoloads.** `/linuxrc` fails
to exec because the built-in ELF loader rejects it. The kernel's fallback - `request_module("binfmt-464c")`
- spawns `/sbin/modprobe` to try to fix that. But `/sbin/modprobe` (a `busybox` symlink) is *also* an
ELF binary, and it *also* gets rejected by the same loader for the same reason, so it *also* falls
back to requesting `binfmt-464c` - spawning another modprobe, which also fails, recursively - burning
through all 50 `kmod_concurrent_max` semaphore slots in about 5 seconds flat. The "kmod busy with 50
threads" message that every previous session (including this one, until now) treated as the root
cause is just where the recursion finally hits its concurrency ceiling - a downstream symptom of a
completely different, upstream bug: **the built-in ELF loader rejects every single binary on this
system**, unconditionally, regardless of content, ABI declaration, static/dynamic linking, or which
file it is (confirmed independently across `busybox`, the from-scratch static `diag_init`, and now
`modprobe` - same binary as busybox via symlink, but a structurally different code path/exec
context, and still identical failure).

**Root-caused precisely by reading `arch/mips/kernel/elf.c`'s `arch_check_elf()`** - the
MIPS-specific ELF arch-check hook, called from the generic ELF loader for *every* exec before any
FP-ABI/interpreter-matching logic even runs:
```c
if (flags & EF_MIPS_NAN2008) {
    if (mips_use_nan_2008) state->nan_2008 = 1;
    else return -ENOEXEC;
} else {
    if (mips_use_nan_legacy) state->nan_2008 = 0;
    else return -ENOEXEC;
}
```
Our toolchain builds legacy-NaN binaries (`BR2_MIPS_NAN_LEGACY=y` in `buildroot.config` - confirmed
this session), so every one of our binaries takes the `else` branch and is unconditionally rejected
unless the kernel's own `mips_use_nan_legacy` global is true. That global is set once at boot by
`cpu_set_nan_2008()` (`arch/mips/kernel/fpu-probe.c`), driven by a live FPU/FCSR capability probe of
this exact XBurst2 core *combined with* the `ieee754=` kernel cmdline parameter (default `strict`,
which trusts the probe outcome completely rather than being permissive). If this non-strictly-compliant
Ingenic core's FPU probe doesn't report legacy-NaN support the way the generic MIPS probe code
expects, `mips_use_nan_legacy` ends up false and every legacy-NaN binary - i.e. everything we ship -
is rejected before ever reaching userspace, independent of anything about kmod, modules, or driver
config.

**Next, concrete, low-risk step**: add `ieee754=relaxed` to `CONFIG_CMDLINE` (the mechanism is
already in place from §35's `initcall_debug loglevel=8` addition) - this unconditionally sets both
`mips_use_nan_legacy` and `mips_use_nan_2008` true, accepting binaries regardless of declared NaN
encoding, sidestepping the FPU-probe question entirely rather than needing to fix the probe itself.
Pure kernel-cmdline change, no rebuild-breaking risk, directly testable.

**Device state**: bootlooping (SPL -> panic -> reboot every ~13s) since `S00revert-safety` can never
run in this failure mode (panic happens before any init.d script executes) - needs the same manual
`--force-swap-ota` mask-ROM recovery documented in §26, not automatic self-heal. Recovery is the
user's own physical action (boot+reset buttons); not something remotely triggerable.

## 37. `ieee754=relaxed` confirmed the fix for real - first ever full custom-kernel boot, live shell, two new small follow-up bugs found

Device recovered to stock via the manual `--force-swap-ota` path (§26/§36), `ieee754=relaxed` added
to `CONFIG_CMDLINE` alongside the existing `initcall_debug loglevel=8`, rebuilt (`xImage` actually
got *smaller*, 5.96MB vs 5.96MB - the panel removal in §35 offset the printk additions), flashed to
the spare slot (both writes md5-verified), marker flipped via the device's own real
`local_set_next_boot_device()`, clean single serial capture, reboot.

**Result: no panic, anywhere, for the first time ever on this track.** The `rosetteos-diag` instrumentation
confirms the exact mechanism understood in §36 is now fixed - every `search_binary_handler` call for
every binary now shows `handler=load_elf_binary retval=0` instead of `retval=-8`. Full init sequence
ran to completion: `S00revert-safety`, `seedrng`, `syslogd`, `klogd`, `sysctl`, `S39wifi` (wpa_supplicant
started but `wlan0` never appeared - expected, no wpa_supplicant config supplied, not a bug),
`S40network` (eth0/wlan0 both time out - expected, no cable/AP), `nginx` (a real but separate bug -
`open() "/usr/off" failed (30: Read-only file system)`), `ustreamer` (`retval=-2`/ENOENT, likely
`/dev/video0` not present without a camera attached), **`S55klipper`/`S56moonraker`/`S58guppyscreen`
all exec'd successfully**, and `S99confirm-good` correctly polled Moonraker's localhost health
endpoint for 150s (30 retries x 5s, real code read from the script itself:
`http://127.0.0.1:7125/server/info`), never got a response, and **correctly left the `ota` marker on
`ota:kernel` (stock)** rather than confirming forward - meaning the *next* reboot self-heals to stock
automatically, exactly as designed. Reached a real `buildroot login:` prompt.

**Logged in over serial for the first time this track** (root / `rosetteos` - hash-verified offline
against `/etc/shadow` before ever trying it live) and used a genuine live shell to check two things
network alone couldn't answer:

- **USB-ethernet dongle plugged in mid-session never enumerated at all** - `/sys/bus/usb/devices/`
  shows only the internal `usb1`/`1-0:1.0` root hub, nothing else, and `ip link show` has no `eth0`.
  Not a driver-loading issue (exec works now) - the kernel never saw a device attach event at all.
  Separate open item - possibly OTG host-mode/DTS `dr_mode`, port wiring, or the dongle itself;
  unconfirmed which.
- **GuppyScreen exec's successfully but exits immediately - root cause found by just running it in the
  foreground**: `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'nlohmann::detail::parse_error'` /
  `[json.exception.parse_error.101] parse error at line 1, column 1: ... unexpected end of input` -
  it's trying to parse a JSON file that's empty or missing entirely, not a framebuffer/touch issue
  (`/dev/fb0` exists, confirmed present). `S58guppyscreen`'s `start-stop-daemon -b` backgrounds with
  no stdout/stderr capture, which is why this was invisible before - the fix for whichever future
  session picks this up is to redirect its output to a real log file, not just re-guess at the cause.

**Both are real but clearly separate from tonight's fix** - the actual multi-day boot blocker (kmod
exhaustion -> recursive modprobe storm -> universal ELF rejection -> MIPS NaN-ABI mismatch) is
resolved and confirmed via a real, complete, successful boot to a working login shell.

## 38. Build scripts cleaned up for reproducibility now that the real fix is confirmed

The `§35-36` `printk` instrumentation in `search_binary_handler()`/`__request_module()` was
diagnostic scaffolding for one specific bug hunt, not a real fix - it added ~500 lines of noisy
`rosetteos-diag:` output to every boot, which would confuse anyone else building this project fresh.
Removed from `vendor/x2000_kernel_6.6` (both `fs/exec.c` and `kernel/module/kmod.c` are now
byte-identical to their pre-instrumentation state - confirmed via `git diff --stat` no longer listing
either file at all), and `patches/x2000_kernel_6.6-rosetteos.patch` regenerated from the cleaned tree
(903 lines, matching the pre-instrumentation patch size exactly).

`CONFIG_CMDLINE` trimmed from `"initcall_debug loglevel=8 ieee754=relaxed"` down to just
`"ieee754=relaxed"` - the first two flags were added alongside the (now-removed) instrumentation for
extra boot-time visibility during the hunt itself; `ieee754=relaxed` is the one line that's an actual,
permanent, necessary fix. Comment rewritten to describe the final, confirmed-working state rather than
the diagnostic journey (still explains the *why* - MIPS NaN-ABI mismatch, `arch_check_elf()`,
`BR2_MIPS_NAN_LEGACY=y` vs the kernel's live FPU probe - just without referencing since-deleted debug
code). Both fragment config copies (`artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` and
`vendor/buildroot-x2000/board/`) kept byte-identical, same as every other change this track has made.

**Rebuilt clean and verified**: `xImage` still 5.96MB (comfortably under the 8MB partition budget),
`ieee754=relaxed` confirmed present in the built `vmlinux`'s string table, zero `rosetteos-diag` strings
anywhere in it, and all four real Kconfig fixes from §35 (`BCMDHD`, `TOUCHSCREEN_GT9XX`,
`HALLEY5_CAMERA_BOARD`, `STAGE_ZC50289HSHD02` all correctly `is not set`) still present. This is now
the actual reproducible state of the fix - a fresh `00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh` through
`05-final-build.sh` run reproduces exactly this, with nothing left over from the investigation itself.
Not yet re-flashed/re-tested against real hardware since the change is a pure subtraction of
debug-only code with no behavioral difference from the already-confirmed-working §37 build - worth a
final confirmation pass before calling this fully done, but low risk.

**Confirmation pass done, same session**: flashed the cleaned build to the spare slot (md5-verified),
flipped the marker via the device's own `local_set_next_boot_device()`, clean capture, reboot. Result
identical to §37 in every way that matters - `Run /linuxrc as init process` at 1.86s (noticeably
faster than the instrumented build, expected with ~500 fewer printks per boot), zero panics, the same
expected non-fatal timeouts (wlan0/eth0 - no wifi config, no dongle detected), the same
`S99confirm-good: Moonraker never confirmed healthy after 150s - leaving ota marker on stock`, reached
`buildroot login:`. The kernel-side fix is confirmed working with the diagnostic instrumentation fully
removed - this closes out the kernel work; the two remaining open items (USB-ethernet dongle not
enumerating at all, GuppyScreen's empty-JSON crash) are userspace/runtime, not kernel-boot issues, and
are next.

## 39. Kernel changes turned into a real fork, not a patch file - repo-structure cleanup now that the boot fix is confirmed

With the actual boot-blocking bug found and fixed (§36/§37), asked the broader question: how should
this project's kernel/userspace/board-fixes/GUI split across repos, the way larger projects do it.
Landed on Buildroot's own idiomatic answer to this exact question - a small `BR2_EXTERNAL`-style tree
(this repo already plays that role) referencing upstream/forked dependencies, rather than a bigger
multi-repo split. The one real gap: the kernel's RosetteOS changes lived as a patch file
(`patches/x2000_kernel_6.6-rosetteos.patch`) applied at build time on top of a third-party clone, not as
real, reviewable git history.

**Fixed**: forked the real upstream kernel repo (`Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`)
to [`coreflake1/NebulaOS`](https://github.com/coreflake1/NebulaOS) via `gh repo fork`. `main` on the
fork tracks upstream unmodified (still exactly `a98c2e1`, "initial release"); a new `rosetteos` branch
carries every RosetteOS kernel change (NS2009 touch, the display panel driver, BT H5 vendor extension,
watchdog fix, DTS wiring, `arch/mips/Kconfig` compression selects, the `binder.h` build fix) as one
real, documented commit on top of that pinned upstream commit - the exact same diff the old patch
file carried, just as committed history instead of a blob.

**Build scripts updated to match**: `00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh` now clones `coreflake1/NebulaOS`
directly and checks out `rosetteos` (was: clone the third-party repo, pin a commit, apply a patch
separately). `01-apply-kernel-patches.sh` no longer applies anything - there's nothing left to apply
- it's now a pure verification step confirming the fork's content landed correctly, kept at its same
pipeline position so the numbered `00`→`06` sequence and any existing muscle memory/docs referencing
it still work. The old patch file removed from this repo (`git rm`) since it's now fully superseded
by the fork's real history - anyone wanting the diff can `git diff a98c2e1 rosetteos` on the fork itself,
or use GitHub's own compare view, both strictly more useful than a static file.

**Verified for real, not just written**: fresh-cloned the fork's `rosetteos` branch into a scratch
directory (same sparse-checkout the build script uses) and diffed it against the local working tree
that's been built and boot-tested twice tonight (§37/§38) - zero source differences, only local build
artifacts (`.config`, `.o`, generated files from the in-place `LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR` build). The fork
really does carry the exact source this whole track has been proving works on real hardware.

**Net effect**: this project is now two repos, not four - this repo (Buildroot config, board fixes,
orchestration scripts, referencing the kernel fork + Buildroot + Klipper/Moonraker/ustreamer as pinned
external sources) and GuppyScreen (already separate, unrelated to the original rosetteos). No new repos
for "userspace" or "Creality fixes" specifically - premature splitting for a project this size right
now; revisit if/when someone else starts contributing to just one layer independently.

## 40. Unattended session: a full hardware sweep, both userspace bugs root-caused, one real fixed+verified, one documented pending review

Run solo while the user stepped away, on the still-running custom kernel from §37/38 (never rebooted
back to stock - real live shell access the whole session via serial, root/`rosetteos`, same as before).
Goal: fix the two open userspace bugs (GuppyScreen crash, USB dongle), and sweep for any other
hardware that isn't being detected correctly.

**Full hardware sweep results:**
- **eMMC**: fully healthy - all 10 real partitions plus both `mmcblk0boot0`/`boot1` hardware boot
  partitions visible in `/proc/partitions`, matching the documented layout exactly.
- **Touch (NS2009)**: working - registered as a real input device (`ns2009_ts`, `mouse0`/`event0`),
  i2c bus 4 address 0x48, matching the DTS.
- **Framebuffer/display**: `/dev/fb0` present, driver name `ingenicfb` - the panel driver itself is
  fine (matches §37's finding that GuppyScreen's black screen was a userspace crash, not a display
  driver problem).
- **Audio**: real sound card registered (`0 [halley5v30]: halley5_v30 - halley5_v30`,
  `x2000-sound sound: Sound Card successed`) - some benign `ASoC: mux LOx_MUX has incorrect number of
  controls` warnings (DAPM route/control-count mismatch, cosmetic, card still registers and works).
- **RTC/watchdog**: both present and responding (`/dev/rtc0`, `/dev/watchdog0`).
- **WiFi SDIO (mmc1)**: **broken, real root cause found and fixed** - see below.
- **USB host**: controller initializes (registers `usb1`, internal root hub only) but nothing external
  ever enumerates - **real root cause found, documented, deliberately not blind-fixed** - see below.
- **Backlight**: no `/sys/class/backlight/` device at all. `ingenic-pwm` itself probes fine
  (`ingenic-x2000 Probe of pwm success!`), but there's no `pwm-backlight`-compatible DTS node wired up
  at all - stock's own `module_driver/pwm_backlight.sh` shows real hardware wiring
  (`pwm_gpio=PC00 power_gpio=PC22 pwm_freq=50000`) that we never added an equivalent for. Screen may
  be running at whatever fixed/default brightness the panel powers up at, with no software control.
  **Not fixed this session** - found late, and every kernel change tonight already needed a full
  dirclean rebuild + real hardware boot test to verify; didn't want to stack a third unverified DTS
  change into one unattended cycle. Real, actionable next item.
- **`/dev/disk/by-partlabel/`**: empty - udev/mdev never ran blkid-based partition-label symlink
  rules. Minor, not currently blocking anything (all partition management happens from stock via SSH,
  not from within this custom kernel), but would matter if that ever changes.

**WiFi SDIO (`mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card`) - real root cause found and fixed.**
Read `wlan_pwrseq`'s own boot-time warning literally instead of assuming it was noise:
`OF: /wlan_pwrseq: #gpio-cells = 3 found 2`. This board's gpio controller binding is `#gpio-cells =
<3>` (pin, active-flag, ingenic bias-flag) - confirmed against stock's own live, decompiled DTB
(every `gpa`/`gpb`/`gpc`/`gpd`/`gpe` node there declares exactly `#gpio-cells = <0x03>`), and every
*other* GPIO reference in our own board file already uses all 3 cells - `wlan_pwrseq`'s `reset-gpios`
was the one exception, only ever specifying 2 (`<&gpd 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>`). `mmc-pwrseq-simple` (the
standard kernel driver that's supposed to toggle the WiFi chip's reset/power-on line before the SDIO
core ever tries to enumerate it) can't reliably act on a malformed GPIO reference - real, live-
confirmed explanation for the SDIO init failure, completely independent of wpa_supplicant config
(which is a separate, already-understood, expected limitation - no config supplied, `wlan0` correctly
never appears - but the SDIO card itself failing is a different, deeper problem that would have
blocked WiFi even with perfect wpa_supplicant config). Fixed by adding the missing 3rd cell
(`INGENIC_GPIO_NOBIAS`, matching the sibling reference two lines up). Committed to the kernel fork
(`coreflake1/NebulaOS`, `rosetteos` branch, `e67eefc40`) and pushed - not yet re-verified on hardware as
of writing this section (rebuild was still running); see the end of this section for the real result.

**USB dongle never enumerating - real root cause found via a real stock-vs-ours DTB comparison, not
guessed.** Decompiled stock's own live device tree (`vendor/device-backups/stock-live-device-tree.dtb`,
using `dtc` already built by tonight's own Buildroot run rather than needing a fresh install) and
compared its real, working USB PHY wiring against ours node-by-node - the same technique that's
found every other real hardware bug this whole track (§32 first, repeated many times since).
**Stock's actual `drvvbus-gpio` (the GPIO that supplies power to the USB bus when acting as host) is
wired to `gpc pin 9`, on the *newer* PHY node** (`otg_new_phy`, compatible `ingenic,usbphy-x2000`) -
stock's *old* PHY node (`otg_phy`, compatible `ingenic,innophy`) carries **zero** GPIO properties at
all. **Our board file has this backwards**: `drvvbus-gpio` is wired to `gpe pin 22`, on the *old*
`otg_phy` node - the wrong pin, on the node whose real, working stock counterpart never uses GPIO
properties in the first place. Practical effect: even though `dr_mode = "otg"` matches stock exactly
(so that alone isn't the differentiator, ruling out an earlier, weaker hypothesis about missing
ID-pin detection), the GPIO that's supposed to actually power the bus for an attached device is very
likely never being driven at all, on either kernel - it's probably just silently ignored by whichever
PHY driver is actually bound (property placed on a node that likely doesn't read it), rather than
being actively harmful. **Deliberately not fixed this session**: correcting this properly likely means
switching which PHY/controller compatible pair is enabled (old `otg`/`otg_phy` vs new
`otg_new`/`otg_new_phy`) - a bigger, less-certain change than moving one GPIO reference, made riskier
by being done unattended with no one available to help recover if a driver-path switch broke the
otherwise-working internal USB bus. Real, concrete, well-evidenced finding for review, not a guess.

**GuppyScreen's `nlohmann::detail::parse_error` crash - real root cause found and fixed.** Traced
every `json::parse()` call site in the GuppyScreen source (`~/Documents/guppyscreen/src/`) that
doesn't disable exceptions. `guppyconfig.json` itself was ruled out first (confirmed present, 1097
bytes, valid/complete JSON, read directly off the device). The real target:
`guppyscreen.cpp`'s startup sequence computes `selected_theme` from `guppyconfig.json`'s `"theme"`
key, defaulting to `"blue.json"` when absent (our config has no `"theme"` key at all), then loads
`<config dir>/themes/<selected_theme>` unconditionally. **`/opt/guppyscreen/themes/` didn't exist on
this rootfs at all** - confirmed directly on the device (`ls`: "No such file or directory"). Root
cause was a packaging gap, not a code bug: the real theme files already exist in the GuppyScreen
source repo itself (`~/Documents/guppyscreen/themes/*.json`, and even in its own built
`releases/guppyscreen/themes/` copy) - they just never got included in this project's Buildroot
overlay (`scripts/build/overlay/opt/guppyscreen/` had `guppyscreen`/`guppybeep`/`guppyconfig.json`/
`thumbnails/`, no `themes/` at all). Diffed our overlay against the real release directory to confirm
nothing else was similarly missing (everything else that differs is either ours-intentionally or
Creality/K1 installer tooling we don't use). **Fixed**: copied all 6 real theme files (`blue`/`red`/
`green`/`purple`/`pink`/`yellow`.json, matching the 6 options `SysInfoPanel`'s theme dropdown actually
offers) into `scripts/build/overlay/opt/guppyscreen/themes/` from the real GuppyScreen source - not
improvised placeholder content.

**Rebuild + re-verification**: both fixes (wlan DTS + guppyscreen themes) went into the same rebuild/
reflash/retest cycle. Real result: **the themes fix was real but insufficient** - GuppyScreen crashed
identically even with the theme files confirmed present and byte-correct on the device. See §41 for
the actual root cause, found by continuing to dig rather than stopping at the first plausible fix.
`mmc1` also still failed with the gpio-cells fix alone, cells warning confirmed gone but the SDIO card
still wouldn't enumerate - see §41 for the follow-up attempt there too.

## 41. The real GuppyScreen root cause (not the themes directory), a second WiFi attempt, and where things stand

**GuppyScreen: the actual bug, found by not stopping at "plausible" - it's a real bug in GuppyScreen's
own source, not a packaging gap.** The themes-directory fix (§40) was real and worth keeping, but a
live re-test showed the identical crash even with the theme file confirmed present and correct on the
device. Traced every `json::parse()` call site again, more carefully this time: both
`config.cpp:69` and `theme.cpp:28` (in `~/Documents/guppyscreen`, this user's own separately-maintained
project) load their JSON file via `json::parse(std::fstream(config_path))`. `std::fstream`'s **default
open mode is read+write** - on this rootfs (squashfs, mounted `ro`), opening *any* file read-write
fails even though the file exists and is perfectly readable (`stat()` succeeds, `open(O_RDWR)`
doesn't) - the failed/unopened stream reads as immediate EOF, and `json::parse()` throws exactly
`unexpected end of input` on startup, before any UI ever shows. Not a missing-file or bad-content bug
at all - a wrong-open-mode bug that could only ever manifest on a read-only rootfs, which is why it
was never caught before: every existing deployment (stock Creality firmware included) keeps
GuppyScreen's directory on a writable partition (`/usr/data/guppyscreen` there, confirmed live via SSH
- not `/opt` at all, that symlink actually points to Creality's own separate `k1_mods` staging area).

**Fixed at the source** (`~/Documents/guppyscreen`, commit `3496b94` on `ke-next`, not pushed):
changed both call sites to `std::ifstream` - config/theme loading never needs to write to these files.
Cross-compiled fresh MIPS binaries via the project's own `scripts/build-mips.sh` (Docker,
`ghcr.io/coreflake1/guppydev:latest`, already present locally), copied into
`scripts/build/overlay/opt/guppyscreen/`. **Confirmed on real hardware**: `ps` shows
`650 root /opt/guppyscreen/guppyscreen` actually running (not crashed), and its own log
(`/opt/printer_data/logs/guppyscreen.log`) shows a completely clean startup - version banner, touch
calibration loaded, the missing-backlight case handled gracefully (matching §40's finding, not fatal),
and an active connection attempt to Moonraker's websocket. This is a real, complete, verified fix.

**Also added `BR2_PACKAGE_STRACE=y`** to the build while chasing this - a permanent, low-risk
diagnostic tool addition (was about to use it to pin down the GuppyScreen bug the hard way before
finding it via source reading instead; kept in since it's generally useful for future debugging on
real hardware where a live shell is the only tool available).

**WiFi SDIO (`mmc1`): a second real attempt, still not resolved.** `drivers/mmc/core/pwrseq_simple.c`'s
`post_power_on_delay_ms` defaults to 0 when unset (`device_property_read_u32` leaves the zeroed
default untouched) - this property was never set on `wlan_pwrseq` at all, meaning the SDIO core was
probing the CYW43438 immediately after its reset line was released, a well-known real failure mode for
this chip class. Added `post-power-on-delay-ms = <200>;`. **Real result: still fails.** `mmc1: Failed
to initialize a non-removable card` persists even with both the gpio-cells fix *and* the delay fix
applied together. The gpio-cells fix is confirmed real and necessary (the kernel warning is
permanently gone), but it alone was never sufficient, and 200ms of extra delay didn't close the gap
either. The DTS comment's own flagged uncertainty (ACTIVE_LOW polarity assumption, "not independently
hardware-verified") remains the most likely next thing to check, but that's a genuine guess rather
than something backed by direct evidence the way the previous two fixes were - **deliberately left
for the next session with the user present**, rather than trying a third unverified guess unattended.

**Final state at end of this unattended session**: device rebooted back to stock (network-accessible,
known-safe resting state) - this was a deliberate choice once GuppyScreen's fix was confirmed working,
rather than leaving the device sitting on the test kernel with no network access. All three real fixes
this session (wlan gpio-cells, wlan post-power-on-delay, GuppyScreen ifstream) are committed and
pushed to the kernel fork (`coreflake1/NebulaOS`, `rosetteos` branch, commits `e67eefc40`/`5dca5971f`) and
committed locally to the guppyscreen repo (`3496b94` on `ke-next`, not yet pushed - the user's own repo,
left for their own review/push decision). The ke-mainline-klipper repo itself (this repo) still has no
remote and several open questions from the repo-restructuring work (§38-39) that were paused mid-way
when this session's priority shifted to the userspace fixes - see the end-of-session summary for the
full list of what's pending a decision.

**Summary of tonight's full hardware sweep** (§40) remains accurate and unchanged - eMMC/touch/
display/audio/RTC/watchdog all confirmed healthy, backlight and USB dongle enumeration remain open,
undocumented-elsewhere items for a future session.

## 42. USB fixed at the devicetree level, then conclusively ruled out as a software problem at all

**The `drvvbus-gpio` pin really was wrong, and it's a real, confirmed fix - just not sufficient to
explain the actual symptom.** Direct comparison against stock's own live, decompiled device tree
(`vendor/device-backups/stock-live-device-tree.dtb`) found stock's real, working `drvvbus-gpio` (the
GPIO that powers the USB bus in host mode) is `gpc` pin 9, not `gpe` pin 22 as our board file had it.
Also confirmed, contrary to an earlier session's (and this session's own initial) suspicion, that this
was never a wrong-driver-path problem - both trees use the identical compatible strings
(`ingenic,x2000-dwc2-hsotg` / `ingenic,usbphy-x2000`), confirmed via stock's own live `dmesg` showing
`13500000.otg_new` as the bound device name (our tree only ever carries this one driver generation,
simply not suffixed `_new` since there's no legacy variant to disambiguate from in this source tree).
Fixed, committed, and pushed to the kernel fork (`coreflake1/NebulaOS`, `rosetteos`, commit `c902097d1`).
Also traced `ingenic,vbus-dete-gpio` (a property our board file sets that stock's real config doesn't)
through `phy-ingenic.c`'s actual source and confirmed it only affects *peripheral/gadget*-mode
connection detection, not host-mode VBUS driving at all - real, valid cleanup to match stock exactly,
but not itself blocking anything for our host-mode use case.

**Rebuilt and reflashed with the fix - external USB still didn't enumerate.** Rather than assume the
fix was insufficient and keep guessing at kernel internals, did the one test that actually settles it:
checked whether the exact same device enumerates on **stock's own presumably-working firmware**.
**It doesn't.** Ran the complete test matrix, live, with the user physically swapping hardware between
each step:
- USB-ethernet dongle alone: nothing (only the internal root hub, `usb1`/`1-0:1.0`).
- A different device (a plain USB flash drive) alone, in either of the board's two physical USB-A
  ports: nothing.
- Both devices simultaneously, one per port: nothing.

Every combination of device x port x stock's own tested firmware produced identical results - no
external USB device has ever enumerated on this physical unit, independent of our kernel, our
devicetree, or which specific device is attached.

**Pushed back on that conclusion before accepting it - real, genuine automount infrastructure exists
on stock for exactly this use case.** `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-mount-udisk.rules` matches
`KERNEL=="sd[a-z]"` (real USB mass-storage device nodes) and runs `/etc/auto_mount_udisk.sh`, which
itself handles NTFS via `ntfs-3g` - genuine, real, vendor-built infrastructure for exactly "insert a
USB stick," not something invented or assumed. This is real evidence the feature is *meant* to work,
which is why "hardware limitation, stop here" wasn't accepted as the final answer without one more
real test.

**Found the actual mechanism this board needs, in `phy-ingenic.c`**: a real, vendor-provided, write-only
sysfs attribute (`sw_switch_hsotg`) exists specifically for boards without ID-pin sensing (ours has
none - `ingenic,id-dete-gpio` is commented out, "shares pins with msc1") to manually force host vs
device role, since the normal automatic ID-pin-triggered role-switching path
(`is_id_host()`/`id_work`) is entirely gated behind `if (usb_phy->id_gpiod)` and never engages at all
without that GPIO.

**Tested directly, live, on our own kernel** (rebooted into it specifically for this):
`echo host > /sys/devices/platform/apb/10000000.otg_phy/sw_switch_hsotg` - the kernel acknowledged it
immediately (`---Forced switching Host mode!` in `dmesg`), confirming the mechanism is real and wired
up correctly on our build. Had the user physically replug both test devices *after* the forced switch,
to rule out a stale connection-state issue. **Still nothing** - `/sys/bus/usb/devices/` stayed at just
the internal root hub, and `dmesg` showed zero USB connection/reset/speed-negotiation activity at all
after the switch, not even a failed attempt.

**Conclusion, now much more strongly evidenced than the first pass**: this isn't a devicetree property,
a driver compatible-string mismatch, or a role-detection/OTG-mode issue - the single most direct
software lever available (the vendor's own manual host-mode override, built for exactly this
no-ID-pin scenario) was pulled directly and produced zero downstream effect. That points at something
below the driver layer entirely - VBUS not physically reaching the connector despite the GPIO
correctly toggling, or the D+/D- data lines themselves not being connected/functional - which needs a
hardware-level check (multimeter/continuity on the actual port, or comparing against a second unit of
the same printer model), not more kernel or devicetree changes. The devicetree fix (`drvvbus-gpio` pin
correction) is real, correct, and stays committed regardless - it's simply not the actual blocker for
the symptom that motivated finding it. Closed as out-of-scope for firmware-level debugging.

## 43. `uart1` (the real mainboard MCU link) wired up for the first time, and a real pin conflict it exposed

Prompted by a real physical constraint: the printer's mainboard and this board's serial debug console
(`uart4`/`ttyS4`) can't be connected at the same time, so once WiFi works, `uart1` becomes the only way
to reach both the Nebula Pad *and* the mainboard MCU simultaneously. Worth verifying now rather than
waiting to discover a problem only once the mainboard is finally reconnected.

**Real, confirmed gap**: `printer.cfg`'s own `[mcu]` section confirms `serial:/dev/ttyS1` is the real,
actual link to the printer mainboard's MCU - but this board's devicetree never referenced `&uart1` at
all, unlike every other UART actually in use (`uart0`/`uart3`/`uart4` all have explicit `pinctrl-0`
assignments). The base `x2000.dtsi` leaves `uart1` with no `status` property at all (defaults to
enabled per devicetree spec), but without a pinctrl assignment the physical TX/RX pins were never
muxed to the UART1 function - the controller was nominally "on" with nothing actually reaching the
connector. Added the missing `pinctrl-0 = <&uart1_pc>` (`x2000-pinctrl.dtsi`'s `gpc 21-24` - the only
real pin group defined for this uart, no ambiguity to resolve, unlike `uart3`'s 2-pin/4-pin choice).

**First real boot test exposed a second, genuine bug**: `pin GPC-21 already requested by
134da000.as-dmic; cannot claim for 10031000.serial`. This board's `&as_dmic` override (a 4-channel
digital-mic array) claims `gpc-21` via `dmic_pc_4ch`, directly conflicting with `uart1_pc`. Checked -
this override had **zero justification comment**, unlike everything else in this file, and this
printer's confirmed real audio path is the speaker/codec (`icodec`, "x2000-sound sound: Sound Card
successed" from earlier boot logs), not a mic array - same bug class as BCMDHD/GT9XX/the camera ISP
pipeline/the second MIPI panel (a vendor reference-board feature enabled without ever being verified
against real hardware, this time actively blocking something confirmed real and needed). Disabled
`&as_dmic` entirely.

**Re-tested, confirmed clean**: `10031000.serial: ttyS1 at MMIO 0x10031000 ... is a uart1` registers
with no conflict. Two *other*, pre-existing pin conflicts remain in the same log (`uart0` vs
`13450000.msc`/eMMC, and `uart3`/Bluetooth vs `10054000.i2c`) - both unrelated to this fix, both
already present before tonight's changes, neither blocking anything currently confirmed needed. Left
alone, flagged for a future pass.

**Not yet tested against the real mainboard** - it was physically disconnected for the USB port
hardware inspection (§42) for the entire duration of this fix, and can't be reconnected until WiFi
works (uart4/serial console and the mainboard connection are mutually exclusive on this hardware,
confirmed by the user - the debug console this whole project has relied on all night literally cannot
be present at the same time as the connection this fix is for). This closes what's confirmed possible
from source alone; the real MCU handshake test is the next real milestone once WiFi is working.

Both commits pushed to the kernel fork (`coreflake1/NebulaOS`, `rosetteos`: `4905cb23e` for the uart1
pinctrl addition, `c60cf4d67` for the `as_dmic` disable).

## 44. The real WiFi root cause: two sessions of devicetree-property tuning were toggling a GPIO pin the chip isn't even wired to

Every WiFi fix so far (§40) worked on real, genuine bugs (`#gpio-cells`, `post-power-on-delay-ms`) but
none of them moved the actual symptom: `mmc_rescan_try_freq()` exhausting every card type at every
frequency with zero response. That symptom means the chip itself was never responding to anything -
not a devicetree-property-level problem, a "is the chip even powered on" problem. Comparing our
properties against Raspberry Pi's known-working CYW43438 reference (done in §40/41) couldn't have
caught this, since a wrong *pin number* on our own board's own wiring has nothing to do with generic
SDIO/pwrseq binding correctness.

**Read the actual vendor SDHCI driver source** (`module_drivers/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-ingenic.c`,
`ingenic_sdio.c`) to understand the real bring-up model. Found `ingenic_sdio_wlan_init()` and
`ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()` (called via `EXPORT_SYMBOL`, meant to be invoked by "a manually
card-detect driver such as wifi" per the function's own doc comment). Also found the real vendor
config: `CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_INGENIC=y` and `CONFIG_BCMDHD=y` are both built statically into our kernel -
but stock's own boot log shows its WiFi mmc host is named `md_ingenic,sdhci.1`, not a devicetree node
name at all, meaning stock doesn't bring this up via static devicetree + built-in driver the way we've
been doing it.

**Went looking for hardware-verified ground truth instead of reasoning further from source alone.**
`vendor/device-backups/nebula_system_backup.bin` is a full 1.5GB dd of the device's eMMC (GPT-parseable
even though the backup itself is truncated relative to the disk's real 6GB+ `userdata` size - `rootfs`,
partition 7, ends well inside the captured range). Extracted it (`dd` with the partition's real
byte offset/size, then `unsquashfs`, both fully read-only) and found stock ships its *entire* board
driver stack - MMC/WiFi, backlight, fb, gpio, i2c, rotator, touch, watchdog - as loadable out-of-tree
`.ko` modules under `/module_driver/`, each with its own `insmod`-with-parameters `.sh` script and one
`driver_default_init_script.sh` that runs them all in order. (The `.ko` files themselves are
`vermagic=4.4.94` - stock runs an ancient 4.4 BSP kernel; this whole project's premise is replacing
that with a real 6.6.18-rt23 kernel, so the binaries themselves are useless to us, but the `.sh`
scripts are exact, real, hardware-verified documentation of the vendor's own wiring.)

**`soc_msc.sh` and `cywdhd.sh`'s insmod parameters gave the real GPIO pins, verbatim**:
`wifi_reg_on=PD04` (port D, pin **4**) and `gpio_wlan_wake_host=PE02` (port E, pin 2) -
cross-confirmed independently against this exact board's own `stock-boot-reference-log.txt` line
`WL_HOST_WAKE=130` (port E is the SoC's 5th gpio chip, 0-indexed: 4*32+2 = 130, exact match, no
ambiguity). There's also a **third gpio these scripts use that had no equivalent anywhere in our
devicetree at all**: `wifi_power_on`/`gpio_bt_wifi_power = PA01` (port A, pin 1), a separate,
shared power-rail enable for the whole combo chip, active-high per the vendor's own
`wifi_power_on_level=1`.

**Our devicetree had been toggling `gpd 1` (port D, pin 1) this whole time** - for both
`wlan_pwrseq`'s `reset-gpios` and `bcmdhd_wlan`'s `gpio_wl_reg_on` - a pin the WiFi chip was never
wired to at all, and never drove the PA01 power-enable line in the first place. This fully explains
the "zero response at every frequency" symptom: the chip was simply never powered on. Fixed both
places to the real pins (`gpd 4` for WL_REG_ON, `gpe 2` for WL_HOST_WAKE), and added `gpa 1` to
`wlan_pwrseq`'s `reset-gpios` alongside `gpd 4` - confirmed via `drivers/mmc/core/pwrseq_simple.c`
that `reset-gpios` is a real gpio *array* (`devm_gpiod_get_array`), toggled together, each line
honoring its own active-flag independently (mixed active-high/active-low in one array is correct,
not a bug, given the vendor's own opposite polarities for these two lines).

**Real hardware boot test (2026-07-21, later still).** Flashed the combined build (this WiFi fix +
the already-built §43 uart1/as_dmic fix, both baked into the same kernel source tree) to the spare
slot via `flash-spare-slot.sh`, flipped the ota marker, rebooted, captured serial clean.

**uart1: CONFIRMED CLEAN, for real this time.** `10031000.serial: ttyS1 at MMIO 0x10031000 ... is a
uart1` registers with zero conflict. The two pin conflicts still present in the same log
(`GPD-23`/uart0/`13450000.msc` and `GPC-25`/uart3/`10054000.i2c`) are the same pre-existing,
already-documented, unrelated ones from §43 - nothing new. §43's fix is now real-hardware-verified,
not just source-reviewed.

**WiFi: still broken, same exact symptom.** `mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card` -
identical message to every attempt before this one. `ingenic,sdhci 13460000.msc: allocated
mmc-pwrseq` did succeed (both `gpa 1` and `gpd 4` resolved as valid gpio phandles, no lookup error),
so the pin numbers are at least structurally wired now - but the card still never responds. Per
[[feedback_verify_fix_worked_not_just_plausible]]: the symptom didn't change, so the hypothesis was
incomplete, not simply "not yet tested." Real candidates for what's still missing, not yet
distinguished: (a) `gpa 1`/`gpd 4`'s active-high/active-low polarity guessed from the vendor's
`_level=` insmod params without ever seeing the param-handling source (closed 4.4 BSP binary) - could
be backwards; (b) toggling both lines simultaneously via one `reset-gpios` array vs. stock's
possibly-sequenced power-on (rail-enable settling before reg_on asserts) - `post-power-on-delay-ms`
only fires after both are already asserted, not between them; (c) still an entirely different pin.
Self-healing worked exactly as designed throughout - `S99confirm-good` correctly never confirmed
this boot (Moonraker never came up healthy, no network at all - both wlan0 and eth0 timed out during
`Starting network`), leaving the ota marker on stock, so the very next reboot returned there with no
manual marker write needed. Device confirmed back on stock via serial, real WiFi reassociating to
"Office_2.4Ghz" - fully healthy, zero side effects from the test.

Full boot log: `vendor/device-backups/custom-boot-wifi-gpio-fix-uart1-combined-20260721.log`.

## 45. Six more real, independently-verified WiFi fixes, all tested on real hardware - the symptom never moved, and hardware-level evidence now says this is likely beyond software alone

Continued autonomously (user's own instruction) after §44's pin fix produced zero change. Every fix
below was rebuilt, reflashed to the spare slot, and boot-tested on real hardware before moving to the
next - none of this was guessed-then-abandoned, each was a real, ruled-in-or-out hypothesis per
[[feedback_verify_fix_worked_not_just_plausible]].

1. **Active-flag polarity was backwards.** Traced `drivers/mmc/core/pwrseq_simple.c`'s actual logical
   sequence (`pre_power_on`→logical 1/asserted, `post_power_on`→logical 0/released, enumeration
   happens at logical-0) against the vendor's own insmod param levels (`wifi_reg_on_level=0`,
   `wifi_power_on_level=1`) and found `gpd4`/`gpa1`'s `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH`/`_LOW` flags were exactly
   inverted from what's needed. Fixed, retested: **identical failure.**

2. **PA01 was silently mux-stolen by our own active serial console.** `x2000-pinctrl.dtsi`'s
   `uart4_pa` group was `<&gpa 0 3>` (pins 0-3, ALL FOUR muxed to UART4 as one atomic group per
   `pinctrl-ingenic.c`'s inclusive-range `pin_bitmap()`), while stock's own live DTB uses a narrower
   `<0x08 0x02 0x03>` (pins 2-3 only). Our always-on debug console was permanently claiming PA1 -
   the exact pin WiFi's power rail needs - with zero error printed (a different pinctrl group
   silently mux-claiming a pin isn't the same code path as the loud "already requested" conflicts
   this driver prints for named-group clashes). Narrowed the template to match stock exactly.
   Retested: **identical failure.**

3. **Modeled PA01 as its own `regulator-fixed` instead of a pwrseq reset-gpios line.** PA01 is a
   shared combo-chip power rail (used by both the mmc host module and the separate wlan module in
   stock's own scripts), not a per-card reset/wake signal - `mmc-pwrseq-simple` can only express one
   shared-delay concept for every gpio in its array together, it can't stage "rail up first with its
   own real ramp-up window, then toggle reset". Wired as `&msc1`'s `vmmc-supply` (confirmed real and
   actively checked by this exact driver - it already prints "No vmmc regulator found" when absent).
   Retested: **identical failure.**

4. **`&msc1`'s own "default" pinctrl state was forcing the RTC32K reference clock OFF.**
   `pinctrl-0 = <&msc1_4bit>, <&rtc32k_disable>` - `rtc32k_enable`/`_disable` mux `gpe23` between its
   real clock-output function and a forced-low state, and this is a real, physical 32kHz reference
   this exact chip class needs running (the vendor's own out-of-tree `ingenic_sdio.c` has a whole
   atomic-refcounted `rtc32k_enable()` mechanism built around this precise pin). Nothing in mainline
   `sdhci-ingenic.c` (unlike the vendor's own bcmdhd path we don't use) ever selects the "enable"
   state - the clock was forced off at every single boot. Swapped to `rtc32k_enable` in the default
   state itself, so the standard driver-core pinctrl binding (zero driver code needed) turns it on
   automatically. Retested: **identical failure.**

5. **Verified the compiled `.dtb` actually reflects every source change**, since 4 real fixes with
   zero symptom movement started to raise the question of whether changes were even taking effect.
   Decompiled the real build-output `halley5_v30.dtb` with `dtc` (via the same `k1-bash-build` docker
   image) and confirmed every property - `vmmc-supply`, the `wifi_bt_power` regulator's `gpio`, the
   single-entry `reset-gpios`, `uart4-pa`'s narrowed pin range - compiled in exactly as written. Ruled
   out "the fix never applied" as an explanation.

6. **Found a real vendor driver-source bug, not a devicetree issue.**
   `sdhci_ingenic_set_clock()` (`module_drivers/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-ingenic.c`) computes the
   correct per-instance clock-control register address via `sdhci_ingenic_get_cpm_msc(host)` into a
   local `cpm_msc` variable - then, for every low-speed (≤400kHz) clock setup (i.e. every single card
   identification attempt, on every controller), writes to the **hardcoded literal `0xB0000068`**
   (`CPM_MSC0_CLK_R`) instead of the `cpm_msc` variable that was computed for exactly this purpose one
   line above. A real copy-paste bug: MSC0 (eMMC) incidentally still worked since it's the one
   actually being hit; MSC1 (WiFi) silently never got its own register write. Fixed to use `cpm_msc`.
   Retested: **identical failure.**

### The real diagnostic breakthrough: dynamic debug + a live GPIO/pinctrl inspection

Rather than guess a 7th devicetree change, enabled `CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG` (already compiled in) live
over serial - `mount -t debugfs`, `echo 'file drivers/mmc/core/* +p' > .../dynamic_debug/control`,
then `echo 13460000.msc > .../unbind` + `.../bind` to force a fresh, fully-instrumented probe without
a whole new build/flash cycle. This produced real, detailed command-level tracing for the first time:

```
mmc1: starting CMD5 arg 00000000 flags 000000e1
mmc1: sdhci: IRQ status 0x00018000
mmc1: req done (CMD5): -145: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
mmc1: starting CMD55 arg 00000000 flags 000000f5   (x5, all identical timeouts)
mmc1: clock 100000Hz busmode 1 powermode 2 cs 0 Vdd 21 width 1 timing 0
mmc1: starting CMD1 arg 00000000 flags 000000e1
mmc1: req done (CMD1): -145: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
```

`IRQ status 0x00018000` decodes to `SDHCI_INT_ERROR | SDHCI_INT_TIMEOUT` - a genuine **hardware
command timeout**, not a software-side misconfiguration. The controller is doing everything right:
real clock at the correct 100kHz identification speed, real CMD5/CMD55/CMD1 commands sent - and the
chip returns absolutely nothing, every time, at every frequency the outer `mmc_rescan_try_freq()` loop
tries (already established in earlier sessions).

Then checked the *live* electrical state directly via `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` and
`/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/.../pinmux-pins`, immediately after triggering that failed probe:

```
gpiochip0 (GPA): gpio-1  (wifi_bt_power_regula) out hi     <- PA01, correctly HIGH (enabled)
gpiochip3 (GPD): gpio-100 (reset)               out lo     <- PD04, correctly LOW (enabled)
pin 151 (GPE-23): 13460000.msc (GPIO UNCLAIMED) function rtc32k-pins group rtc32k-enable
```

Every single one of the six fixes above is confirmed **live, electrically correct, exactly as
designed** - the power rail is genuinely driven high, the reset/enable line is genuinely at the
vendor's documented enable level, the reference clock is genuinely muxed to its real clock-output
function, not forced off. And the SDIO chip still does not respond to a single command.

### Where this leaves things

This is a materially stronger stopping point than "tried some things and gave up": six independent,
real bugs were found and fixed (each individually justified, several likely also fixing real problems
on other boards derived from this same vendor SDK/kernel fork), and the software/devicetree stack is
now *confirmed* to be doing everything correctly at the electrical/register level. The remaining
failure mode - total silence from the chip at every command, every frequency, with correct power,
clock, and bus wiring all independently verified - points at something outside what devicetree or
driver-source changes can reach from here: either a hardware-level fault or wiring difference on this
specific unit (needs a multimeter/oscilloscope check of the actual WL_REG_ON/PA01/CLK pins during a
real boot, the same class of verification that eventually closed out the USB investigation in §42), or
a genuine, still-undiscovered timing/sequencing requirement that only the vendor's exact closed-source
module binary knows about.

**Not closing this out as "solved" or "impossible" - closing this specific investigation approach as
exhausted**, with a clear, evidence-backed recommendation: the next productive step needs either
physical measurement tools or a second reference unit for comparison, not another devicetree
guess. Device left safely on stock (self-healing confirmed it throughout - `S99confirm-good` never
saw Moonraker healthy on any of these six attempts and correctly left the marker on stock every time,
zero manual intervention needed for safety). All six fixes are real and stay committed regardless of
the open WiFi question - `uart1`/`as_dmic` (§43) is independently confirmed working, and none of these
six changes are wrong, they just aren't sufficient on their own.

## 46. User correctly pushed back on §45's conclusion as overconfident - real stock forensics instead of more devicetree guessing, two more real attempts, still open

§45's framing ("likely beyond software alone") was too confident given one directly available fact:
**stock WiFi works on this exact physical unit.** A live chip that responds correctly to stock's own
kernel is strong evidence against "electrically dead," and CMD5/CMD55/CMD1 timeouts under *our*
bring-up sequence prove the device isn't answering *that* sequence - not that it's faulty. Corrected
course: pulled real, live forensics from stock instead of guessing at more devicetree changes.

### Real stock forensics

SSH'd into stock and ran a proper diagnostic sweep (SDIO sysfs identity, `/sys/kernel/debug/mmc1/ios`,
dmesg, module locations, init.d ordering, the actual `soc_msc.ko`/`cywdhd.ko` insmod scripts). Real,
concrete findings:

- SDIO identity confirmed: vendor `0x02d0`, device `0xa9a6` (matches CYW43438, already known).
- **The exact real boot sequence**, never seen this directly before: `soc_msc.ko` loads at `S11`
  (very early - `msc1_rst=-1 msc1_pwr=-1`, this module has **zero gpio power/reset config of its
  own**), then `cywdhd.ko` loads immediately after, and its own `dhd_module_init()` does ONE
  automatic power-test cycle (real GPIO toggle via its own direct `gpio_direction_output()` calls,
  bypassing devicetree/pwrseq entirely) - card responds within ~300ms, then gets **immediately
  powered back off**. The REAL, lasting power-on (`bcm_wlan_power_on, RESET`) only happens ~5 seconds
  later, from `S44wifi_bcm_up`'s `wifi_up.sh` (`rfkill unblock wifi` + `ifconfig wlan0 up`).
- Confirmed: stock's `mmc1` is a **pure platform_device** (`md_ingenic,sdhci.1`, no devicetree node at
  all - matches §44's earlier finding of `status="disabled"` in the static DTB), created and
  parameterized entirely via `soc_msc.ko` module parameters, not `mmc-pwrseq-simple`/`vmmc-supply`.

### Two more real, structurally different attempts (bringing the total to eight)

**Attempt 7 - port the vendor's manual-insert glue, not the whole driver.** `cywdhd.ko`'s own
`dhd_wlan_set_power()` calls the already-exported `ingenic_bcmdhd_wlan_power_onoff(MANUALLY_INSERT)`
(→ `rtc32k_enable()` + `ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl()` + `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`) after its own gpio
sequencing - this exact function is already compiled into *our* kernel too (same source file,
`ingenic_sdio.c`, built via `CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_INGENIC=y`). Added a `late_initcall` in `ingenic_sdio.c`
that calls it once, reusing our already-electrically-verified `wlan_pwrseq`/`wifi_bt_power` gpio
sequencing (§45) instead of re-implementing gpio control from scratch. **Confirmed running correctly**
(dmesg: `rosetteos_wifi_manual_insert: triggering manual SDIO insert on mmc1` / `wlan power on:2`) -
**identical timeout regardless.**

Traced why: `drivers/mmc/core/core.c`'s `mmc_start_host()` (called from every `mmc_add_host()`,
unconditionally, for every mmc host) *already* does one automatic `mmc_power_up()` + rescan at msc1's
own probe time, completely independent of `non-removable`/`cd_type` - removing `non-removable`
wouldn't have prevented this either, since the trigger for the initial scan is generic, not
quirk-gated. By the time attempt 7's `late_initcall` ran, the pwrseq gpios were already sitting at
whatever level that earlier, automatic cycle left them at - a *level* recheck, not a fresh
*transition*. This is exactly the gap the user flagged: final GPIO state was checked in §45, never the
actual edge.

**Attempt 8 - force a real transition immediately before detection.** Modified
`ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()` itself (real driver source, not devicetree) to call
`mmc_power_off(host->mmc)` + `msleep(50)` + `mmc_power_up(host->mmc, host->mmc->ocr_avail)` right
before its existing `mmc_detect_change()` call - forcing a genuine off-then-on cycle through our
already-verified-correct pwrseq path at the exact moment of the real, intentional trigger, not relying
on stale state from minutes-earlier automatic probing. (`mmc_power_up`/`mmc_power_off` are real,
non-static, built-in mmc-core functions - declared only in the core subsystem's *private* header, so
a manual `extern` was needed since this driver is built directly into vmlinux, not a loadable module.)
**Confirmed running, identical timeout again.**

### Honest status, not a re-declaration of "hardware dead"

Eight real, independently-reasoned, real-hardware-tested attempts, spanning devicetree config (pin,
polarity, pinmux conflict, regulator model, clock enable), a real driver-source bug fix, and now two
attempts at the vendor's actual manual-insert architecture with a forced electrical transition - none
have changed the symptom. What remains genuinely open, not concluded:

- **Exact pulse timing/duration is still a guess.** `msleep(50)` before power-up, `200ms` after - both
  chosen as "generously safe" values, never measured against what stock's own `dhd_gpio.c` actually
  waits (its exact `mdelay`/`msleep` values weren't extracted from live stock forensics this round -
  a concrete, cheap thing to pull next: `strings`/disassemble `cywdhd.ko` or trace GPIO timestamps
  live on stock with a logic analyzer or even instrumented dmesg timestamps around the real
  `bcm_wlan_power_on` cycle).
- **Physical measurement remains the most information-dense next step** - a multimeter/oscilloscope
  check of `PD04`/`PA01`/the CLK line during a real power-on, on *this* unit, would directly show
  whether our forced transition (attempt 8) actually reaches the physical pins as intended, or whether
  something in the pin's electrical path (pull-up/pull-down mismatch, drive strength, a level shifter,
  or a genuinely different pin on this specific board revision) prevents it from ever being a real
  factor. This is a "what would most efficiently resolve the remaining uncertainty" recommendation,
  not a claim that the hardware is faulty - stock's own real-time behavior on this exact unit is
  direct proof the hardware works.

Device left safely on stock throughout (self-healing confirmed working correctly on both new attempts
- zero manual marker intervention needed). All eight fixes/attempts stay committed; none are wrong,
none are proven sufficient yet either.

## 47. The real root cause of every prior WiFi attempt: wrong driver entirely - found via disassembling stock's own working binary, not another devicetree guess

User pushed back a second time, more specifically: stop guessing GPIO delays, trace and reproduce
stock's *exact* implementation using the source and binaries already available, since stock WiFi
demonstrably works on this exact unit. Right call - this section is the direct result.

### Disassembly, not speculation

Pulled `cywdhd.ko` (stock's real WiFi driver) live off the running device and disassembled it with
the project's own MIPS cross-toolchain (`mipsel-linux-gnu-objdump`, via the same `k1-bash-build`
docker image already used for everything else). Its symbol table was NOT stripped - real function
names, real call graphs, no guessing required:

- `bcm_wlan_power_on()` disassembled directly: for the "manual insert" path, it does
  `gpiod_set_raw_value(desc, 0)` → `msleep(100)` → `gpiod_set_raw_value(desc, 1)` → calls
  `jzmmc_manual_detect(index, 1)`. `desc` resolves (via the `.data` symbol table) to `wlan_reg_on`,
  a plain integer GPIO number populated from the `gpio_wlan_reg_on=PD04` module param - confirms the
  real, physical WL_REG_ON toggle sequence byte-for-byte, straight from the vendor's own compiled
  code, not reconstructed from param names alone.
- Critically: `cywdhd.ko` calls **`jzmmc_manual_detect()`/`jzmmc_clk_ctrl()`** - real, exported
  symbols. These do **not exist** in `sdhci-ingenic.c` (what this entire board file has used via
  `CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_INGENIC` since the project began). They exist in **`ingenic_mmc.c`** - a
  completely separate, older-style MMC/SD driver already present in this exact kernel source tree,
  never used by this board file until now. Confirmed directly in source:
  `ingenic_mmc.c`'s own `jzmmc_manual_detect()`/`jzmmc_clk_ctrl()` are one-line wrappers (explicit
  comment: `/* for module driver */`) around its own `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`/
  `ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl()`.

**Every one of the eight prior WiFi attempts (§44-46) was correctly diagnosing and fixing real bugs
in the wrong driver.** Stock never used `sdhci-ingenic.c` for msc1 at all.

### The actual mechanism, confirmed in source, not assumed

`ingenic_mmc.c` has a real `.get_cd` callback (`ingenic_mmc_get_card_detect`, returns whether
`INGENIC_MMC_CARD_PRESENT` is set) - for `removal=MANUAL` devices, this bit is **never set** until
`ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()` explicitly flags it. `sdhci-ingenic.c` has **no `.get_cd` callback at
all** - confirmed by reading its full `sdhci_ops` struct back in §44-46's own investigation. Mainline
`drivers/mmc/core/core.c`'s `mmc_start_host()` unconditionally does one `mmc_power_up()` + rescan for
every registered mmc host, regardless of `non-removable`/quirks - with no `.get_cd` to say otherwise,
this always resulted in real CMD5/CMD55/CMD1 being blindly sent before the chip was ever really ready,
producing the identical "Failed to initialize a non-removable card" timeout on all eight prior
attempts, no matter how correct the pin/polarity/clock/regulator config underneath it was.

### Making the switch

`INGENIC_MMC`'s Kconfig only listed older XBurst SoCs (`SOC_X1600`/`X1000`/`X1800`/`X1021`/`X1520`/
`X1630`) - relaxed to also allow `SOC_X2000` after confirming (by grep) the driver itself has zero
hardcoded SoC-specific register addresses; it's devicetree/clock-framework driven exactly like
`sdhci-ingenic.c`. Enabled `CONFIG_INGENIC_MMC=y` + `CONFIG_INGENIC_MMC_MMC1=y` (msc0/msc2 stay on the
old driver - already working, no reason to touch them). Changed *only* msc1's devicetree `compatible`
from `"ingenic,sdhci"` to `"ingenic,x1600-mmc"` - specifically the x1600 variant because its
clock-name convention (`div_msc%d`/`gate_msc%d`) matches what `sdhci-ingenic.c` already uses and what
msc0/eMMC already proves works on this SoC's real clock provider (the generic `"ingenic,mmc"` variant
uses a different, unverified `cgu_msc%d` naming).

**Real build bug found and fixed along the way**: `sdhci-ingenic.c` and `ingenic_mmc.c` both
independently define `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`/`ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl()` - a genuine link-time
`multiple definition` error the instant both are built into the same vmlinux (they were only ever
designed as alternatives for different SoC generations, never linked together before). Renamed
`sdhci-ingenic.c`'s copies to `sdhci_ingenic_mmc_manual_detect`/`sdhci_ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl` (nothing
external calls them anymore, since msc1 - the only real caller - now resolves to `ingenic_mmc.c`'s
implementation via `ingenic_sdio.c`'s existing header-conditional include).

### Real hardware result: the old symptom is gone, replaced by a new, more specific one

Rebuilt, reflashed, rebooted. **`"mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card"` no longer
appears at all** - direct, real confirmation the `.get_cd`-gated premature auto-scan is genuinely
eliminated, exactly as the mechanism above predicts. The existing manual-insert `late_initcall` (§46)
fired correctly (`rosetteos_wifi_manual_insert` / `wlan power on:2`) and this time triggered a REAL
`ingenic_mmc.c`-level transaction attempt - which produced a new, much more specific, driver-level
timeout with a full register dump:

```
ingenic,mmc 13460000.msc: timeout 3000ms op:0  sz:0 state:1 STAT:0x00000000 DMALEN:0x00000000 blks:0/0 clk:enable
ingenic,mmc 13460000.msc: request time out, op=0 arg=0x00000000, sz:-1B state=1, status=0x00000000, ...
REG dump: CTRL2=0x00000002 STAT=0x00000000 CLKRT=0x00000007 CMDAT=0x00000080 ... IMASK=0x03F70000 IFLG=0x070FFFFF CMD=0x00000000 ...
```

`op:0`/`op:8`/`op:5`/`op:55` confirm the driver genuinely attempts the full standard identification
sequence (CMD0, CMD8, CMD5, CMD55) exactly as it should - `CTRL2` being non-zero shows register
access to the controller works in general; `STAT` staying at `0x00000000` through every single
attempt, at the actual hardware register level, is now the concrete, specific, remaining question -
narrower and more actionable than the generic mmc-core-level timeout every prior attempt produced.

**Real side effect discovered**: the perpetual 3-second retry timer this driver runs while a request
never completes (real code: `ingenic_mmc_request_timeout()`, re-arms itself indefinitely) blocked a
clean kernel reboot - `device_shutdown()` hung inside `mmc_host_classdev_shutdown()`'s
`flush_work()` call, waiting on a work item that never quiesces. `reboot`/`reboot -f`/SysRq `b` all
hit the same kernel-internal `device_shutdown()` path and couldn't unstick it from userspace - the
device's own hardware watchdog (already confirmed present and working) eventually forced the actual
reset. No risk in this: `S00revert-safety`'s marker was already pointed at stock from the start of
this boot, so the eventual watchdog-forced restart landed safely on stock regardless, same as every
other test this session - but worth flagging as a real, reproducible consequence of this specific
failure mode if this driver work continues.

### Where this leaves things

This is real, substantial, hardware-confirmed progress, not a repeat of §45/46's pattern - a whole
class of prior guesswork (every devicetree GPIO/polarity/clock tweak) is now confirmed unnecessary to
revisit, since the actual driver architecture is now provably correct, matching stock's own compiled
binary exactly. The remaining question is narrower and more concrete than before: why does `STAT`
never show any activity at the hardware register level once the correct driver is finally in place.
Six real, independently-verified fixes (§45) plus this driver switch are ALL still correct and worth
keeping regardless of how this resolves. Device left safely on stock (via watchdog-forced recovery,
confirmed via `/proc/cmdline` and real WiFi reassociation afterward).

## 48. `ingenic_mmc.c` instrumented to the register level, then a second disassembly (this time of stock's actual MSC1 driver binary, not just the WiFi module) reversed §47's driver-family conclusion

A long, heavily-instrumented follow-up to §47's `STAT` mystery, ending in a real pivot back to the
driver family §47 moved away from - and a sobering, honestly-reported real-hardware result. Recorded
in full because every step produced real, kept evidence, even though the net symptom is unchanged from
before §47 ever started.

### Phase 1: bounded retries and clean shutdown (real, kept fix)

Before further diagnostics, fixed the exact reboot-hang mechanism §47 flagged: `ingenic_mmc_request_
timeout()`'s retry ladder allowed up to 20 reschedules (60 real seconds) per failed request before
ever calling `mmc_request_done()`. Bounded to one reschedule (~6s total), added the requested
`"MSC1-DIAG: request failed, retries exhausted, completing request"` log line, and added `del_timer_
sync()` for both `request_timer`/`detect_timer` to `mmc_ingenic_remove()`/`mmc_ingenic_shutdown()`
(neither previously touched them at all). Confirmed twice on real hardware: a `reboot` issued while
the retry timer was actively armed completed cleanly in both the old driver (before this fix existed,
where it caused a genuine kernel panic on `device_shutdown()`) and, after the fix, on live boots where
it no longer needed the watchdog to recover.

### Phase 2: `CTRL`/CPM/clock instrumentation on `ingenic_mmc.c` - two real hypotheses closed with hardware evidence, one real bug fixed

Added: a `CTRL` register dump line (previously missing from `ingenic_mmc_dump_reg()`), a
`msc_wait_internal_clock()` bounded 1ms poll for `STAT_CLK_EN` (bit 8) right after reset, a raw CPM
register dump (`ingenic_mmc_dump_cpm()`, reading `MSC0CDR`/`MSC1CDR`/`CLKGR`/`MPDCR` directly via
`ioremap` of the real X2000 CPM physical base `0x10000000`) printing MSC0 and MSC1 side by side, and
clock-acquisition logging at probe (`clk_get`/`clk_set_rate`/`clk_prepare_enable` results and rates).
Along the way, fixed a real, silent bug: `if (!host->clk_cgu)` doesn't catch `devm_clk_get()` failure
(`ERR_PTR`, never `NULL`) - present identically in stock's own 4.4.94 source, harmless there only
because its `clk_get()` calls never actually fail. Changed to `IS_ERR()`.

Real hardware results, in order:

- **Power-domain gate ruled out.** `MSC0`/`MSC1` `pd_en` read identical (both enabled), and the raw
  `MPDCR` register read `0x00000000` in its entirety throughout - this power-domain layer isn't
  gating anything on this silicon, closing a real, plausible hypothesis with register evidence rather
  than leaving it dangling.
- **External clocks ruled out.** `MSC1-CLK-DIAG` showed `clk_cgu`/`clk_gate` as real, valid pointers,
  both reporting `enabled=1` after `clk_onoff(1)`, rate landing at 23.4375MHz (375MHz/16, correct
  integer-divider rounding for a 24MHz request - not a bug).
- **A real, novel, but ultimately non-explanatory finding**: MSC1's CGU divider "busy" bit (bit 28 of
  `MSC1CDR`) read `1` continuously from probe through roughly 30 seconds of uptime, while MSC0's read
  `0` the entire capture - a real, asymmetric, timing-correlated phenomenon that directly explains why
  the recurring `"wait cgu stable timeout!"` warning (`drivers/clk/ingenic-v2/clk-div.c`) specifically
  tracks MSC1/WiFi bring-up. But `STAT` stayed `0x00000000` both while busy and after it cleared -
  real, but not suffient on its own.
- **The decisive test**: gated command submission on `STAT_CLK_EN`, refusing cleanly with
  `-EIO`/a clear log line if unset. Real hardware result: `"MSC1-DIAG: internal clock failed
  CTRL=00000000 STAT=00000000"` - the MSC1 controller's internal SD/MMC clock never starts at all,
  confirmed directly rather than inferred from a stuck command.

### A live stock reference read disproved the `STAT_CLK_EN` interpretation entirely

Before building further on that "decisive" result, read the live, raw `STAT` register (via `/sbin/
devmem`, discovered available directly on stock - no kernel module needed) on the actual, currently-
associated, actively-transferring stock system: **`STAT=0x00007080` - bit 8 (`STAT_CLK_EN`) clear**,
on a system with real, live SDIO traffic in flight (bits 7/12/13/14 - FIFO/data-done/SDIO-IRQ-active -
were set, confirming genuine activity). Stock's own `soc_msc.ko` reset sequence, captured live (see
below), also showed `CTRL=0`/`STAT=0` immediately after reset, with stock proceeding to working WiFi
right after. **`STAT_CLK_EN` is not a valid "is the internal clock running" signal on this MSC
revision** - the sec-51 gate that concluded otherwise was wrong, and was removed. This is exactly the
kind of conclusion the project's own standing rule (check the working reference before trusting a
failure-only signal) exists to catch, and it worked as intended here.

### A live stock capture attempt - real data, a real vendor-module bug hit, and a real (recovered) kernel panic

Given the plan to trace stock's own reset/clock-start/first-command sequence directly rather than
guess further, wrote a script to `rmmod cywdhd; rmmod soc_msc`, poll `CTRL`/`STAT`/etc. via `/sbin/
devmem` in a tight loop, then `insmod soc_msc.ko`/`cywdhd.ko` with their real, extracted insmod
parameters (`/module_driver/{soc_msc,cywdhd}.sh`) while capturing. Real result: `soc_msc.ko`'s own
reset showed the identical `STAT=0x00000000` transient stock's real driver produces too - useful,
real confirmation this specific transient is normal. But `cywdhd.ko` failed to reload (`insmod: can't
insert 'cywdhd.ko': File exists` - a real, pre-existing cleanup bug in the vendor module's own
`module_exit`, leaving a stale `md_bcmdhd_bt_power` sysfs kobject behind), so the actual manual-
detect/CMD5 sequence was never captured. That stale kobject later caused a genuine kernel panic
(`device_shutdown` → `kobject_get` on the corrupted device tree) on a subsequent `reboot` attempt -
recovered automatically and cleanly via the kernel's own panic-timeout auto-reboot, confirmed healthy
afterward (fresh boot, `cywdhd`/`soc_msc` loaded cleanly, `wlan0` up with a real IP and active
traffic). No persistent damage, since none of this touches boot partitions - but confirmed live
`rmmod`/`insmod` reloading of these two modules on stock is **not a safe repeatable technique** and
should not be attempted again; a cold-boot-synchronized trace (temporary init-script hook, or a real
instrumented rebuild of `soc_msc.ko`) is the safe alternative if this is revisited.

### The actual pivot: disassembling stock's real, live `soc_msc.ko` - not just `cywdhd.ko` this time

The single highest-value action of this whole segment: pulled stock's actual, live, working `/module_
driver/soc_msc.ko` off the device and disassembled it (same `mipsel-linux-gnu` toolchain used on
`cywdhd.ko` in §47). Its own symbol table proves, directly, that **stock's real msc1 driver has always
been `sdhci-ingenic.c`, not `ingenic_mmc.c`**: genuine `sdhci_ingenic_probe`/`sdhci_ingenic_set_clock`/
`sdhci_ingenic_power_set`/`sdhci_ingenic_hwreset` symbols, real calls into `sdhci_add_host()`/
`sdhci_alloc_host()`/`sdhci_reset()`/`sdhci_set_bus_width()` (genuine SDHCI-framework functions), *and*
its own real, exported `jzmmc_clk_ctrl`/`jzmmc_manual_detect` symbols - the exact two names §47's
`cywdhd.ko` disassembly found, which is what pointed at `ingenic_mmc.c` in the first place, since that
driver happens to also define functions with these names. §47's "wrong driver entirely" finding was
itself wrong: `ingenic_mmc.c` was never stock's msc1 driver at all.

Confirmed our own `sdhci-ingenic.c` already has the matching, correct architecture for this: `cd_type
== SDHCI_INGENIC_CD_PERMANENT` (set from the `"non-removable"` devicetree property, already present)
sets `MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE` + `SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION` at probe time, and its own real,
exported manual-detect function flips `SDHCI_DEVICE_DEAD` and calls `mmc_detect_change()` - genuinely
the same mechanism stock uses. Also confirmed, directly from stock's real insmod parameters
(`msc1_cd_method=non-removable`), that stock uses the standard `non-removable` devicetree-equivalent
property, not a `MANUAL`-mode `pdata->removal` field - and that `pdata->removal` is never actually
read anywhere in our `sdhci-ingenic.c` outside a dead, commented-out parsing block, so this was never
functionally gating anything (`manual_list` registration in this driver is unconditional).

### The pivot, applied

- `halley5_v30.dts`: `&msc1`'s `compatible` reverted from `"ingenic,x1600-mmc"` back to the base
  `"ingenic,sdhci"`.
- `halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`: `CONFIG_INGENIC_MMC` fully disabled (was `=y` with
  `CONFIG_INGENIC_MMC_MMC1=y`) - nothing needs `ingenic_mmc.c` anymore.
- `sdhci-ingenic.c`/`sdhci-ingenic.h`: the §47 rename (`sdhci_ingenic_mmc_manual_detect`/
  `sdhci_ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl`, done to dodge the link collision with `ingenic_mmc.c`) reverted back
  to the original `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect`/`ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl` names, since `ingenic_sdio.c`'s
  glue calls those exact literal names and the collision no longer exists.

**Real build-environment friction, unrelated to the code**: the kernel config fragment edit didn't
take effect until an explicit `make linux-reconfigure` was run (Buildroot doesn't always re-merge
fragments into an already-configured kernel `.config` just because the fragment file changed) - and
that in turn needed host tools (`file`, then `cpio`/`unzip`/`rsync`/`bc`) that a fresh `--rm` docker
container doesn't have until installed. Compounded by a genuinely degraded/flaky network reaching the
Ubuntu mirrors during this exact window (dual-stack IPv6 routing failures, then partial-batch fetch
failures, then a very slow but eventually complete fetch) - real, external, and unrelated to the
firmware work itself, but it cost significant real time before the actual rebuild could run.

### Real hardware result: the identical pre-§47 symptom is back

Rebuilt, reflashed, rebooted. The driver binds correctly (`mmc1: SDHCI controller on ingenic-sdhci
[13460000.msc] using ADMA`), the manual-insert `late_initcall` fires exactly as designed
(`rosetteos_wifi_manual_insert` → `wlan power on:2` → `ingenic,sdhci 13460000.msc: card insert
manually`) - but:

```
[    2.204433] mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card
[    3.264963] mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card
```

The exact same message every one of the original 8 attempts hit, before the driver-mismatch theory
was ever found. Every GPIO/polarity/rtc32k/regulator/pwrseq fix from that era (§44/§45/§46) is still
present in the devicetree and still didn't change this outcome.

### Where this honestly leaves things

Not a wasted detour - real facts were established that were not known before, and are worth keeping
regardless of what comes next:

- Stock's real msc1 driver is `sdhci-ingenic.c`, confirmed at the symbol level from stock's own live
  binary, not inferred. This is no longer in question.
- `STAT_CLK_EN` is confirmed, from a live working stock read, not a valid "internal clock running"
  signal on this MSC revision - future instrumentation should not gate on it.
- The CPM power-domain layer and the external clock framework are both confirmed not to be the
  blocker, with direct register evidence, not assumption.
- The bounded-retry/clean-shutdown fix is real and independent of which driver family is used - kept.
- The remaining gap is real and still unexplained: with the *architecturally correct* driver, correct
  removal mode, correct manual-detect mechanism, and every previously-found GPIO/polarity/power fix
  all in place simultaneously, `sdhci-ingenic.c`'s actual SDIO identify sequence still fails the same
  way it always has. This means the blocker was never really about driver-family choice - something
  in the SDHCI-standard register/init path itself (or a hardware precondition common to both driver
  families) is still missing, and has been missing since before §47 even started.

Session paused here, deliberately, to consolidate findings before choosing a next direction, per
explicit instruction rather than continuing to test speculatively. Device left safely on stock
throughout (confirmed via live WiFi reassociation before and after every real-hardware cycle this
segment).

## 49. A real, paired stock-vs-custom CMD5 register trace - a genuine race condition found and fixed, but the actual root cause turns out to be one level deeper: the chip itself never answers on custom

Direct instruction this session: stop guessing, capture the first successful stock CMD5 and the
first failed custom CMD5 at the register level, using the same tool/addresses on both sides, and
patch the first *proven* divergence - not another plausible-sounding theory.

### Method

**Stock side**: a small statically-built MIPS binary (`msc1_sampler.c`, built with the project's own
`pellcorp/k1-bash-build` toolchain at `-mabi=32 -EL -mnan=2008 -march=mips32r2`, verified byte-for-
byte ELF-flag-identical to stock's own `/bin/busybox` before trusting it) mmaps `/dev/mem` read-only
over MSC1's SDHCI register block (phys `0x13460000`) and the CPM `MSC1CDR` clock-divider register
(phys `0x100000a4`), tight-loop-polling and logging only *changed* 32-bit words with a monotonic
timestamp. Installed via a temporary, self-deleting `/etc/init.d/S10wifitrace` hook (deletes itself
as its literal first action, launches the sampler in the background so it never blocks the rest of
`rcS`) that ran for exactly one real cold boot, then never again. Confirmed self-deleted and the
trace log pulled off afterward; no lasting change to stock survived past that one boot.

**Custom side**: real kernel-side instrumentation (`rosetteos_msc1_trace()`, temporary, `sdhci-
ingenic.c`), polling the *same* register set at the *same* physical addresses via the host's own
already-mapped `host->ioaddr` plus a small `ioremap()` of the same CPM register, called synchronously
right after `mmc_detect_change()` inside `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()` for a bounded 2-second window.
Same offsets, same format, directly diffable against the stock capture - no separate decode step
needed for the comparison itself.

Both captures are real, live, timestamped, and kept (trimmed excerpts below; full logs are large).

### What the first pass found: a real, provable race condition

The very first custom capture showed `mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card` firing at
kernel time 2.258s - **before** `rosetteos_msc1_trace`'s own command activity (which only starts at
2.513s) ever got underway. Cross-referencing timestamps: `mmc1` registers at 1.333s,
`mmc_start_host()`'s own automatic power-up+rescan (real, unconditional, generic mainline
`drivers/mmc/core/core.c` behavior - already known from §46) doesn't report its own failure until
2.258s, **nearly a full second later**. This session's own manual-insert power-cycle
(`mmc_power_off()` → `msleep(50)` → `mmc_power_up()`) runs at ~1.77s - squarely inside that window,
while the automatic rescan may still be issuing commands against the same chip. Stock has no
equivalent race: its manual insert (`dhd_module_init`'s own power-up sequence) is the *only* rescan
ever run against `md_ingenic,sdhci.1`.

**Fix** (`sdhci-ingenic.c`, `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`): one line,
`cancel_delayed_work_sync(&host->mmc->detect)`, immediately before the existing power-cycle.
`cancel_delayed_work_sync()` (unlike a bare cancel) blocks until any *currently executing* instance of
the host's detect work has actually finished, not just cancels a future reschedule - guaranteeing the
automatic rescan is fully done, not just no-longer-pending, before this function cuts power to the
chip.

**Built, flashed to the spare slot, and tested on real hardware.** Confirmed via the second trace: the
race is genuinely gone - only one `"Failed to initialize"` message this time (the automatic rescan's
own, at 2.175s, cleanly before the manual sequence starts at 2.482s - no more interleaving), and the
manual sequence itself completes 3 clean, non-overlapping retry cycles before giving its own single
`"Failed to initialize"` at 3.601s. **This is a real, verified fix and is being kept** - it removes a
genuine bug independent of whether it explains the WiFi symptom.

### The decisive finding: it doesn't explain the WiFi symptom - the chip itself never answers on custom

**WiFi still did not come up** (`wlan0` never appeared) even with the race fixed. But the two register
traces, captured with the *identical* tool at the *identical* addresses, converge on a single,
unambiguous, no-decoding-required signal: `SDHCI_RESPONSE_0` (offset `0x10`), the register that
latches the actual response the card sends back and *holds that value* until the next command
overwrites it (unlike an interrupt-status bit, it can't be missed between polls):

```
stock:   MSC1+0x10 changes 110 times across the capture, e.g.
         0.587141 MSC1+0x10 = 0x00001002
         0.601978 MSC1+0x10 = 0x00001003
         0.900157 MSC1+0x10 = 0x00001006
         ... (real, varying, non-zero response values throughout)

custom (race fixed):  MSC1+0x10 changes 0 times after the initial baseline read.
                       Every single command, across all 3 clean retry cycles, gets no response at all.
```

Every other register this session traced (`PRESENT_STATE`, `CLOCK_CONTROL`, `CAPABILITIES`,
`INT_ENABLE`/`SIGNAL_ENABLE`, the `COMMAND` register's own written values, the CPM `MSC1CDR` divider)
matches between stock and custom closely enough to rule out the SDHCI hardware/software path itself:
the controller issues the identical command family in the identical order every retry
(`CMD52→CMD5→CMD55→CMD1`, sometimes `+CMD8`), `PRESENT_STATE`'s command-inhibit bit toggles correctly
around every command (proving real completions/timeouts are happening, not a stuck controller), and
the CPM divider's real bit-28 "busy" state - the leading theory at the end of §48 - reads `0` on
*both* stock and custom throughout, cleanly closing that theory with fresh, paired, apples-to-apples
data rather than the earlier single-sided measurement.

**This directly answers the mission's own decision tree: Case E.** The SDHCI command engine is
confirmed working, correctly, on custom - the divergence is entirely upstream of it. The physical
WiFi chip is not answering CMD5 (or anything else) at all, on any of 3 real, cleanly-separated retry
attempts, at the exact moments custom asks. Every previously-verified GPIO/pinctrl/regulator/rtc32k
fix (§44-46) is still real and still in place - what's not yet proven is whether the *timing* of that
sequence (settle time between the real REG_ON/reset transition and the first CMD5) matches what this
specific chip actually needs, versus what stock's own `dhd_module_init` sequence - a different,
multi-step, vendor-specific choreography - actually gives it.

### Real hardware safety record this session

- Stock's temporary trace hook (`S10wifitrace`) confirmed self-deleted after its one intended boot.
- Two full custom boot/flash/test cycles, both via the spare `kernel2`/`rootfs2` slot only - the
  active stock slot was never written to. Both `xImage`/`rootfs.squashfs` writes were md5-verified
  byte-for-byte before every boot attempt.
- `S00revert-safety` confirmed, both times, to have already flipped the ota marker back to
  `ota:kernel` early in the custom boot (read directly off `/dev/mmcblk0p1`) - each subsequent reboot
  landed cleanly back on stock without any manual marker intervention needed.
- WiFi reassociation (`wl_bss_connect_done succeeded`) and a real DHCP lease confirmed on stock after
  every cycle.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point (the known unsafe path from §48) - all
  stock-side evidence came from either a read-only live parameter/dmesg check, a live rfkill power-
  cycle (the same action `wifi_up.sh` performs any time WiFi reconnects), or the one instrumented cold
  boot above.
- Printer confirmed idle (`print_stats.state == "standby"`) before every reboot.

### Net result

- **Real, kept fix**: the `mmc_start_host()`-vs-manual-insert race on custom, closed via
  `cancel_delayed_work_sync()`. Independent of the WiFi symptom, this was a genuine correctness bug.
- **Real, kept instrumentation**: `rosetteos_msc1_trace()` in `sdhci-ingenic.c`, still present in the
  tree - cheap (one bounded, read-only 2-second window, only on manual insert) and has already once
  earned its keep. Worth a decision next session on whether to strip it now that the race is fixed, or
  keep it for the next real hardware cycle.
- **The actual root cause is now much more sharply scoped than at the end of §48**: not the SDHCI
  register/software path (proven, with paired evidence, to behave correctly), not the CPM busy-bit
  theory (proven false on both sides with fresh data), not the automatic-rescan race (real, but fixed,
  and didn't change the outcome) - but a WiFi chip that never answers a single command across 3 clean
  attempts on custom, while answering 110+ times on stock. The next concretely-scoped question is
  timing: does the chip get the same real settle time between its actual power/reset transition and
  the first CMD5 on custom as it does via stock's own `dhd_module_init` choreography, and if not,
  where exactly does that gap come from.
- Device left safely on stock, WiFi confirmed working, at the end of this session.

## 50. Isolating the stock power choreography by disassembly - a real, verified polarity bug found and fixed, and the actual blocker narrowed to the mmc-pwrseq-simple GPIO-array write path itself

Direct follow-up instruction: stop at the SDHCI boundary was correct (sec 49 proved the host command
engine works), now reproduce stock's exact Wi-Fi power/reset choreography and port the first proven
divergence - not another timing guess.

### 1. Stock power call graph (from real disassembly, not inference)

Pulled `/module_driver/cywdhd.ko` and `/module_driver/soc_msc.ko` fresh off the running stock device
again and disassembled with `objdump -dr` (relocations included this time, not just `-d` - the `.ko`
is unlinked, so plain disassembly shows `lui v0,0x0` placeholders for every symbol reference; only
`-r` resolves them to real names). Found the real, exact call graph:

```
S11module_driver_default
  insmod soc_msc.ko (msc1_is_enable=1, msc1_rst=-1, msc1_pwr=-1, msc1_cd_method=non-removable, ...)
    sdhci_ingenic_probe(msc1) -> sdhci_add_host()   [mmc1 registered, no card yet]
  insmod cywdhd.ko (wlan_mmc_num=1, gpio_bt_wifi_power=PA01, gpio_wlan_reg_on=PD04, ...)
    dhd_module_init() -> wifi_platform_bus_enumerate()
      bcm_wlan_power_on(1):
        ingenic_rtc32k_enable()
        gpio_to_desc(wlan_reg_on=PD04); gpiod_set_raw_value(desc, 0)   # raw LOW = held/reset
        msleep(100)
        gpio_to_desc(wlan_reg_on); gpiod_set_raw_value(desc, 1)        # raw HIGH = enabled
        jzmmc_manual_detect(wlan_mmc_num=1, on=1)                      # called immediately, no extra delay
          -> mmc_detect_change(mmc1, 0) -> mmc_rescan -> CMD52/CMD5/CMD55/CMD1 -> CMD3 (success)
  (later, S44wifi_bcm_up) wifi_up.sh: rfkill unblock wifi -> dhd_bus_devreset() -> bcm_wlan_power_on() again
```

`bcm_wlan_power_off()` is exactly symmetric: `gpiod_set_raw_value(wlan_reg_on, 0)` then
`ingenic_rtc32k_disable()`. Both directions cross-confirm the same polarity: **raw LOW is
held/disabled, raw HIGH is the real enabled state**, and detection is triggered essentially
immediately after the raw-HIGH write - the entire real settle time is the 100ms low-hold, not a
post-enable delay. `PA01` (the shared power rail) is never touched by either function - matches this
project's own choice (already modeled as an always-on regulator, `wifi_bt_power`, not cycled per
power-on/off) with real evidence rather than an assumption.

### 2. Custom power call graph

```
kernel boot
  sdhci_ingenic_probe(msc1, &msc1 DT node, mmc-pwrseq=<&wlan_pwrseq>)
    ingenic_sdio_wlan_init() -> rtc32k_init() [pinctrl handle for "enable"/"disable" states]
    mmc_of_parse(host->mmc) -> mmc_pwrseq_alloc() [host->pwrseq attached - confirmed live, see below]
    sdhci_add_host() -> mmc_add_host() -> mmc_start_host()
      automatic mmc_power_up() + mmc_rescan (delayed work) - fails ~1s later
late_initcall: rosetteos_wifi_manual_insert()
  ingenic_bcmdhd_wlan_power_onoff(MANUALLY_INSERT):
    rtc32k_enable() -> pinctrl_select_state("enable")
    ingenic_mmc_clk_ctrl(1) -> clk_prepare_enable(clk_cgu/clk_gate)
    ingenic_mmc_manual_detect(1, on=1):
      cancel_delayed_work_sync(&host->mmc->detect)   [sec 49 race fix]
      mmc_power_off(host->mmc)   -> mmc_pwrseq_power_off()   [reset-gpios asserted]
      msleep(50)
      mmc_power_up(host->mmc, ocr) -> mmc_pwrseq_pre_power_on() + ... + mmc_pwrseq_post_power_on()
      mmc_detect_change(mmc1, 0) -> mmc_rescan -> CMD52/CMD8/CMD5/CMD55/CMD1 (repeats, never reaches CMD3)
```

### 3. RTC32K comparison: no divergence found

`ingenic_sdio.c`'s own `rtc32k_enable()` re-selects the `"enable"` pinctrl state on every power-on
call (refcounted, but genuinely re-applied each time ref count goes 0->1) - the same
"re-assert every power-on cycle" pattern stock's disassembly shows for `ingenic_rtc32k_enable()`.
Real, checked, not a divergence.

### 4. The real polarity bug, found by disassembly and fixed

The sec 40/44/48 comments in `halley5_v30.dts` had reasoned about `wifi_reg_on_level=0`
purely from the *module parameter name*, never from the real driver's own instructions - exactly the
trap this investigation's own instructions warned against. The real disassembly (part 1 above) proves
that reasoning was backwards: raw HIGH is the enabled state, not raw LOW.

**Fixed** (`halley5_v30.dts`, `wlan_pwrseq`'s `reset-gpios`): `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH` -> `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW`
for `gpd 4` (so `mmc_pwrseq_simple`'s `post_power_on()` logical-0 release lands on the real,
disassembly-proven raw-HIGH enabled state), and removed the second `gpd 1` entry entirely - the same
disassembly proves stock's real driver never reads or touches a second GPIO in either
`bcm_wlan_power_on()` or `bcm_wlan_power_off()`, so `gpd 1` (adopted from a generic vendor SDK
reference tree in sec 48, not this board's real running driver) was an unproven guess.

**Verified applied on real hardware**: `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` (mounted fresh, read live during the
custom boot) shows `gpio-100 (|reset) out lo ACTIVE LOW` - confirms the descriptor really is
registered with the corrected polarity flag.

**Result: WiFi still did not come up.** Rebuilt, flashed, tested on real hardware
(`local_set_next_boot_device`, serial capture, `S00revert-safety` confirmed the marker already
reverted to stock before I ever touched it). `rosetteos_msc1_trace` still reported
`"no SDHCI_RESPONSE_0 change across the whole window - chip never answered"`.

### 5. Following the divergence one level deeper: the GPIO never actually reaches raw HIGH

Rather than guess at a second theory, added direct instrumentation to observe the *live* GPIO value
during the real power-up call, since the disassembly proved raw-HIGH is what the chip needs and the
DT fix was confirmed applied. Added:

- `rosetteos_msc1_trace()`: also polls `gpio_get_value(100)` (WL_REG_ON's real global gpio number,
  confirmed via debugfs above) every ~200-300us alongside the SDHCI registers it already tracked.
- A diagnostic right after `mmc_of_parse()` in probe: `host->mmc->pwrseq` printed directly. Confirmed
  non-NULL for msc1 (NULL for msc0/msc2, which have no `mmc-pwrseq` property) - `host->pwrseq` *is*
  correctly attached; ruled out a simpler "pwrseq never allocated" theory cleanly.
- Point-in-time `power_mode`/live-GPIO logging at all four steps of `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`'s
  own sequence (before `mmc_power_off()`, after it, after the `msleep(50)`, after `mmc_power_up()`).

**Real hardware result, in order:**

```
before power_off: power_mode=0 WL_REG_ON=0   <- already off/low - the automatic rescan's own
                                                 cleanup already ran (its "Failed to initialize"
                                                 fires at the same timestamp, microseconds apart)
after power_off:  power_mode=0 WL_REG_ON=0   <- mmc_power_off()'s own early-return guard fires
                                                 (already MMC_POWER_OFF) - genuinely a no-op, expected
after msleep(50): power_mode=0 WL_REG_ON=0   <- unchanged, expected
after power_up:   power_mode=2 WL_REG_ON=0   <- power_mode DID transition 0->2 (MMC_POWER_ON) -
                                                 mmc_power_up() genuinely ran its full sequence,
                                                 including mmc_pwrseq_pre_power_on() and
                                                 mmc_pwrseq_post_power_on() - but the GPIO never left 0
```

`gpio_get_value()` reads raw, unfiltered by the active-flag (confirmed in source:
`gpiod_get_raw_value(gpio_to_desc(gpio))`) - same as what `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` itself displays, so
this isn't a logical-vs-raw reading mismatch. `mmc_pwrseq_simple_post_power_on()` calls
`mmc_pwrseq_simple_set_gpios_value(pwrseq, 0)`, which for an `ACTIVE_LOW`-flagged descriptor should
drive raw HIGH via `gpiod_set_array_value_cansleep()` - real mainline code, read directly
(`drivers/mmc/core/pwrseq_simple.c`), not assumed. It provably runs (`power_mode` proves
`mmc_power_up()`'s full body executed), yet the pin measurably never moves.

### Where this honestly leaves things

Not resolved this session, but narrowed with real, layered, hardware-verified evidence at every step,
each one closing a real candidate rather than leaving it open:

- The SDHCI register/software path: proven correct (sec 49).
- The `mmc_start_host()`-vs-manual-insert race: real, found, fixed, verified (sec 49) - kept.
- The CPM MSC1CDR "busy bit" theory from sec 48: proven false on fresh, paired data on both sides.
- `host->pwrseq` never attaching: proven false - it's genuinely non-NULL for msc1.
- WL_REG_ON polarity being backwards from the module-parameter-name assumption: real, disassembly-
  proven, fixed, and confirmed *applied* (`ACTIVE LOW` live in debugfs) - kept, even though it alone
  didn't resolve the symptom.
- **What's left, precisely scoped**: `mmc_power_up()` demonstrably runs its complete pwrseq sequence
  (`power_mode` transitions `0`->`2`), the reset-gpios descriptor is confirmed correctly flagged
  `ACTIVE_LOW`, yet the physical WL_REG_ON pin never reaches raw HIGH. The remaining gap is inside
  `mmc_pwrseq_simple`'s own GPIO-array write path
  (`mmc_pwrseq_simple_set_gpios_value()` / `gpiod_set_array_value_cansleep()`) or this platform's
  own gpiolib/pinctrl `.set` callback underneath it - not the devicetree configuration, which is now
  confirmed correct against stock's real, disassembled behavior.

**Concretely scoped next step**: bypass the generic, array-based `mmc-pwrseq-simple` mechanism for
this one GPIO and drive it directly from `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()`, the same way stock's own
`bcm_wlan_power_on()`/`bcm_wlan_power_off()` do (a single, direct `gpiod_set_raw_value()`-style call
on the WL_REG_ON descriptor, byte-for-byte matching the real disassembled sequence: raw 0, real
100ms hold, raw 1, detect immediately) - rather than continuing to trust a generic framework path this
session's own live evidence shows isn't reaching the pin on this exact platform.

### Real hardware safety record this session

- Five full build/flash/boot/revert cycles this session, every one via the spare `kernel2`/`rootfs2`
  slot only - the active stock slot was never written to. Every `xImage`/`rootfs.squashfs` write was
  md5-verified byte-for-byte before boot.
- `S00revert-safety` confirmed (read directly off `/dev/mmcblk0p1`) to have already reverted the ota
  marker to `ota:kernel` early in every custom boot, before any manual intervention. One cycle also
  showed `S99confirm-good`'s own 150s Moonraker-health timeout firing independently and correctly
  leaving the marker on stock - a second, independent layer of the same safety net working exactly as
  designed.
- Printer confirmed idle (`print_stats.state == "standby"`) before every reboot.
- WiFi reassociation (`wl_bss_connect_done succeeded`) and a real DHCP lease confirmed on stock after
  every single cycle.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point - all stock-side evidence this session
  came from static disassembly of files pulled read-only off the live device.
- Six real, isolated commits landed on the fork's `rosetteos` branch this session (a catch-up commit for
  previously-uncommitted sec 44-48 work, the sec 49 race fix, gated tracing, the sec 50 polarity fix,
  WIFI_SEQ markers, and the live-GPIO/pwrseq diagnostics) - each independently reviewable, none mixing
  unrelated changes.

## 51. Bypassing the broken `mmc_pwrseq_simple` GPIO path - WL_REG_ON now proven to physically reach the
correct stock state, and the real blocker is now one level deeper still

Direct, narrowly-scoped follow-up: stop debugging the generic pwrseq framework, drive WL_REG_ON
directly from `sdhci-ingenic.c` instead, and reproduce stock's exact raw sequence.

### The change

- **`halley5_v30.dts`**: WL_REG_ON (`gpd 4`/PD04) moved out of `wlan_pwrseq`'s `reset-gpios` entirely.
  That node had no other real purpose on this board, so it - and the `mmc-pwrseq = <&wlan_pwrseq>;`
  reference - was removed outright rather than left half-used. A new, dedicated `&msc1` property,
  `wlan-reg-on-gpios`, takes its place. **Verified via a decompiled build-output DTB** (`dtc -I dtb -O
  dts`) that PD04 now has exactly one consumer in the compiled tree, and no `reset-gpios`/`mmc-pwrseq`
  reference survives anywhere.
- **`sdhci-ingenic.h`**: new `wlan_reg_on` field on `struct sdhci_ingenic`.
- **`sdhci-ingenic.c`**: acquired at probe with `devm_gpiod_get_optional(dev, "wlan-reg-on",
  GPIOD_ASIS)` + `gpiod_direction_output_raw(desc, 0)`. `ingenic_mmc_manual_detect()` now drives it
  with `gpiod_set_raw_value_cansleep()` - never the active-flag-translating
  `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` - reproducing stock's disassembled `bcm_wlan_power_on()` sequence
  exactly: raw LOW, real 100ms hold, raw HIGH, detect triggered immediately with no invented delay
  after the HIGH transition. `mmc_power_off()`/`mmc_power_up()` are kept immediately before/after the
  GPIO toggle for their other real effects (voltage/clock setup via `mmc_set_ios()`) - now that PD04
  is out of pwrseq, they can no longer touch this pin either way, so keeping them is free.

### Real hardware result: the physical pin finally reaches the correct state

```
[1.271852] rosetteos: WLAN_REG_ON GPIO acquired, direction_output_raw(0) ret=0
...
[1.828400] rosetteos: WIFI_SEQ: WL_REG_ON requested_raw=0 descriptor_raw=0
[1.835329] rosetteos: WIFI_SEQ: sleeping 100 ms
[1.980629] rosetteos: WIFI_SEQ: WL_REG_ON requested_raw=1 descriptor_raw=1
[1.987551] rosetteos: WIFI_SEQ: triggering manual detection
[1.993176] rosetteos_msc1_trace:      0 ms WL_REG_ON (gpio 100) = 1
```

Confirmed **two independent ways**: the `gpiod_get_raw_value_cansleep()` readback taken immediately
after the write, and `rosetteos_msc1_trace`'s own separate live GPIO poll (added in sec 50, unchanged) -
both agree the pin is physically HIGH. This closes the `mmc_pwrseq_simple` hypothesis completely and
with certainty: WL_REG_ON now reaches exactly the raw state stock's own driver requires, at
essentially the same ~100ms real timing stock uses.

**WiFi still did not come up.**

```
[2.144759] mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card
[3.993190] rosetteos_msc1_trace: no SDHCI_RESPONSE_0 change across the whole window - chip never answered
```

`SDHCI_RESPONSE_0` never changed once, across the entire post-detect window, exactly as before the fix
- despite the one signal every prior theory (the automatic-rescan race, the reset-gpios polarity, and
now the pwrseq GPIO-array bug) predicted would matter now genuinely being correct.

### Where this leaves things (this investigation's own Case B)

Not resolved this session, but a real prerequisite is now proven satisfied rather than assumed:

- The SDHCI register/software path: proven correct (sec 49).
- The `mmc_start_host()`-vs-manual-insert race: found, fixed, verified (sec 49) - kept.
- WL_REG_ON polarity and, now, the entire GPIO delivery mechanism: found, fixed, and **verified to
  physically reach the exact stock-required raw-HIGH state** (sec 50 + this section) - kept.
- **What's left**: with WL_REG_ON now provably correct, the remaining candidates are the ones this
  investigation's own decision tree lists for exactly this outcome - RTC32K's actual physical
  routing/pinmux (not just its clock-framework-visible enabled state), the real delay from raw-HIGH to
  first CMD5 versus what this specific chip needs, MSC1's own CLK/CMD/DAT pinmux and pull
  configuration, the shared Wi-Fi/BT power rail's (`wifi_bt_power` regulator, PA01) actual live state,
  and the Wi-Fi host-wake/wake-host lines. None of these has yet been checked with the same
  disassembly-first, live-verified rigor applied to WL_REG_ON in sec 50-51 - that is the concretely
  scoped next step, not a fresh guess.

### Real hardware safety record this session

- One more full build/flash/boot/revert cycle (six total across sec 49-51), again via the spare
  `kernel2`/`rootfs2` slot only, `xImage`/`rootfs.squashfs` md5-verified before boot.
- Before flashing, verified in the compiled DTB (not just the source) that PD04 has exactly one owner
  and no `reset-gpios`/`mmc-pwrseq` reference survives - the exact check this investigation's own
  build procedure calls for.
- `S00revert-safety` confirmed (read directly off `/dev/mmcblk0p1`) to have already reverted the ota
  marker before any manual intervention, as in every prior cycle.
- Printer confirmed idle before the reboot. WiFi reassociation and a real DHCP lease confirmed on
  stock afterward.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point.
- One real, isolated commit this section (`mmc: sdhci-ingenic: drive WLAN_REG_ON directly during
  manual insertion`), on top of the six from sec 49-50 - seven total on the fork's `rosetteos` branch
  from this whole investigation, each independently reviewable.

## 52. The real root cause: PA01 (the shared Wi-Fi/BT power rail) had the same class of unverified
polarity bug as WL_REG_ON - fixing it produced the first real SDIO response and enumeration this
entire investigation has ever seen

Direct follow-up: with WL_REG_ON proven correct, compare stock and custom pinmux/RTC32K/timing with
no-build, no-flash comparisons first, and patch only the first proven divergence.

### Phase 1-2: MSC1 pin table and RTC32K - both ruled out, correctly, after resolving phandles

Decompiled the actual packaged custom DTB (`dtc -I dtb -O dts`, sha256
`ce55a791dd8c...fa039fba6`) and compared against `vendor/device-backups/stock-live-device-tree-
decoded.dts`, resolving every phandle to its real node rather than trusting raw numbers (a real trap
this investigation's own instructions warned about, and one this session nearly fell into: stock's
`msc1-4bit` raw pinmux value `<0x06 0x08 0x0d>` looks like "bank 6" at first glance, but `0x06` is
just `&gpd`'s auto-assigned phandle in that specific compilation, confirmed by cross-referencing
`gpd`'s own `linux,phandle = <0x06>` a few lines above it in the same dump):

- **MSC1 CLK/CMD/DAT0-3 pinmux**: stock resolves to `&gpd 8 13`, function 0. Custom:
  `<&gpd 8 13>`, `PINCTL_FUNCTION0`. **Identical.** Ruled out.
- **RTC32K enable path** (the one actually exercised - `rtc32k_enable()` runs on every real power-on
  call, on both stock and custom): stock resolves to `&gpe 23 23`, function 0. Custom:
  `<&gpe 23 23>`, `PINCTL_FUNCTION0`. **Identical.** Ruled out for the current symptom.
- **RTC32K disable path**: a real, source-confirmed divergence exists here - stock's own vendor
  source (`vendor/x2000_kernel/arch/mips/boot/dts/ingenic/x2000-v12-pinctrl.dtsi`) uses
  `PINCTL_FUNCTIONS` (12, a sentinel/count value, likely a deliberate no-op that leaves the clock
  running), custom uses `PINCTL_FUNCLOLVL` (5, forces the pin to a real GPIO-low output, actually
  killing the clock). Real, but **not exercised** in our current boot sequence - nothing calls
  `ingenic_bcmdhd_wlan_power_onoff(0)` (the only caller of `rtc32k_disable()`) during the manual-insert
  path this investigation tests. Documented, not yet fixed - low priority unless a future session's
  own power-off/suspend path starts exercising it.

### Phase 7 (moved up, given the tools already in hand): the shared Wi-Fi/BT rail

Rather than reason about PA01 from stock's module-parameter name again (`bt_wifi_power_valid_level=0`
had been sitting in this investigation's own documentation since the very first session, never once
checked against a live read), read it directly: `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` on the real, currently
running, currently-associated stock system, during real WiFi traffic:

```
gpio-1   (                    |bt_wifi_power       ) out lo
```

**Raw LOW, on real, live, working stock.** This directly and unambiguously confirms
`bt_wifi_power_valid_level=0`: raw LOW is genuinely the enabled state for this shared rail.

Custom's `wifi_bt_power_regulator` (`regulator-fixed`, wired as `&msc1`'s `vmmc-supply`) had
`GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH` + `regulator-always-on` + `regulator-boot-on` - driving PA01 to raw HIGH at boot
and holding it there permanently. **The exact same class of mistake sec 50 found and fixed for
WL_REG_ON** - an assumption read from a parameter name, never checked against stock's own live state,
on the *other* real GPIO this investigation has touched. `enable-active-high` (also present) turned
out to be completely dead code on this kernel version - read `drivers/regulator/fixed.c`'s own
`of_get_fixed_voltage_config()` directly: it never parses that property at all, only `regulator-
boot-on`, `startup-delay-us`, `off-on-delay-us`, and `vin-supply`. Polarity is controlled entirely by
the `gpio` cell's own active-flag. Removed along with the fix.

**Fixed**: `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH` -> `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW`.

### Real hardware result: the first real SDIO response and enumeration this investigation has ever seen

```
[1.993188] rosetteos_msc1_trace:      0 ms WL_REG_ON (gpio 100) = 1
[2.007950] rosetteos_msc1_trace:     14 ms first SDHCI_RESPONSE_0 change: 0x00000000 -> 0x20ffff00
[2.418750] mmc1: new high speed SDIO card at address 0001
[2.441304] brcmfmac: brcmf_fw_alloc_request: using brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio for chip BCM43430/1
[2.450426] brcmfmac mmc1:0001:1: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.ingenic,halley5.bin failed with error -2

[3.485049] brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_htclk: HT Avail timeout (1000000): clkctl 0x50
```

`SDHCI_RESPONSE_0` changed - for the first time in every trace this whole investigation has captured
(sec 49, 50, 51 all showed zero changes, ever). The SDIO card enumerated for real:
`"new high speed SDIO card at address 0001"`, the exact success message stock's own boot log shows.
**`brcmfmac` binds and correctly identifies the real chip** - `BCM43430/1`, the same actual silicon
as stock's `CYW43438` (Cypress acquired Broadcom's WiFi business; CYW43438 is the rebranded
BCM43430/1). Confirmed live via `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` after boot: `gpio-1 (|wifi_bt_power_regula)
out lo ACTIVE LOW` - matches stock exactly.

**This was the real root cause.** Every hardware-level prerequisite this investigation set out to
verify - the SDHCI register/software path (sec 49), WL_REG_ON's raw electrical sequence (sec 50-51),
MSC1's pinmux, RTC32K's active-path pinmux - is now confirmed correct, and the physical, electrical
chain from host to chip is genuinely working.

**`wlan0` still does not appear** - but the reason is now a real, narrow, purely software one:
brcmfmac can't find its firmware blob (`brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin`, error -2 = file not found) in the
custom rootfs's `/lib/firmware/brcm/`. This is a firmware-packaging gap, not a hardware, pinmux, power,
or timing one - stock's own `cyw43438-7.46.58.13.bin`/`nvram_azw372.txt` (Broadcom DHD driver naming)
aren't directly usable by mainline `brcmfmac` (different driver, different firmware format/naming
convention), so this needs either linux-firmware's own BCM43430 blob or a real, verified-compatible
conversion - a genuinely new, concretely scoped, much narrower next task.

### Where this leaves things

- The SDHCI register/software path: proven correct (sec 49).
- The `mmc_start_host()`-vs-manual-insert race: found, fixed, verified (sec 49) - kept.
- WL_REG_ON polarity and delivery mechanism: found, fixed, verified physically correct (sec 50-51) -
  kept, and genuinely necessary (without it, PA01 alone would not have been enough either).
- MSC1 pinmux and RTC32K's active enable path: confirmed identical to stock, with phandles properly
  resolved rather than trusted at face value.
- **PA01/shared-rail polarity: found, fixed, and verified to produce the first real SDIO response and
  enumeration this whole investigation has recorded.** This is the real root cause this investigation
  was searching for.
- **New, narrow, concretely scoped next step**: get a real, brcmfmac-compatible firmware blob (and
  NVRAM, if brcmfmac needs one for this chip/board combination) into `/lib/firmware/brcm/` in the
  custom rootfs, matching the exact filename `brcmfmac` requests (`brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin`, or the
  more specific `brcmfmac43430-sdio.ingenic,halley5.bin` board-specific variant if one exists) - not
  a hardware question anymore.

### Real hardware safety record this session

- One more full build/flash/boot/revert cycle, via the spare slot only, `xImage`/`rootfs.squashfs`
  md5-verified before boot.
- All comparison work in Phase 1-2 and the PA01 live read were done with zero hardware risk: reading
  an already-decompiled DTB, comparing against an already-captured live-device-tree dump, and a
  read-only `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` read on the currently-running, currently-healthy stock system.
- `S00revert-safety` confirmed (read directly off `/dev/mmcblk0p1`) to have already reverted the ota
  marker before any manual intervention.
- Printer confirmed idle before the reboot. WiFi reassociation and a real DHCP lease confirmed on
  stock afterward.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point.
- One real, isolated commit this section (`mmc: msc1 dts: fix wifi_bt_power (PA01) shared-rail
  polarity - this was the real root cause`) - eight total on the fork's `rosetteos` branch from this
  whole investigation, each independently reviewable.

## 53. Wi-Fi actually works: real firmware, real association, real DHCP lease, on the custom Linux 6.6
kernel, on real hardware

The finish line. With the hardware chain fully proven (sec 49-52), this section closes the two
remaining gaps - firmware packaging and a real config-path bug - and confirms full, real, end-to-end
WiFi on the custom kernel for the first time in this project's history.

### Firmware inventory (real, from the live stock device)

```
/lib/firmware/wifi_bcm/cyw43438-7.46.58.13.bin   406602 bytes  sha256 60dbb5b7...52d720
/lib/firmware/wifi_bcm/nvram_azw372.txt             962 bytes  sha256 78fee458...cfb0a
```

Confirmed via `strings` on the firmware binary: `43430a1-roml/sdio-...Version: 7.46.58.13 (r688474
CY)... Date: Thu 2018-04-19 21:19:09 PDT` - the exact same version string this project has seen in
every stock boot log throughout this investigation. The NVRAM is plain LF-terminated ASCII
(`key=value` lines, `#` comments - the same format `brcmfmac`'s own parser, `drivers/net/wireless/
broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/firmware.c`, expects natively, confirmed by reading it directly), headed
`# NVRAM file for BCM943430WLSELG` - the real module part number for this exact chip family. Its own
`macaddr=00:11:22:33:44:55` field is explicitly commented as a placeholder ("just placeholders, need
to be updated"), and `il0macaddr=00:90:4c:c5:12:38` doesn't match this device's real runtime MAC seen
in earlier boot logs (`00:90:4c:11:22:33`) - confirmed no device-unique data in this file. `sibling
/lib/firmware/wifi_bcm/{fw_bcm43438a1.bin,nvram_ap6212a.txt}` exist on the device too but are for a
different, unused module variant - not what this board's real, live boot log picks (`cywdhd.ko` reads
the SDIO card's own CIS tuples at runtime and explicitly selects the Azurewave-branded pair).

**Not committed to this repo**: proprietary Cypress/Broadcom binaries with no accompanying license
file found anywhere on the device - no clear basis to redistribute through this repo (see the
licensing/redistribution guidance this session's own instructions called for). `scripts/build/fetch-
wifi-firmware.sh` extracts them live, read-only, off a real stock device instead - gitignored, staged
under `scripts/build/overlay/lib/firmware/brcm/` for `02-configure-buildroot.sh` to pick up.

### First attempt: correctly packaged, still not found - a real rootfs-timing race

Naive placement (files verified byte-for-byte present in the final packaged `rootfs.squashfs` via
`unsquashfs -ll` and an extracted-and-hashed round-trip, matching source hashes exactly) still hit:

```
brcmfmac mmc1:0001:1: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin failed with error -2
```

Real cause, not a packaging bug: `CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=y` (built directly into the kernel) means its
firmware request runs synchronously inside the same early-boot `late_initcall` window
`rosetteos_wifi_manual_insert()` uses to force the manual SDIO insert (sec 46) - real hardware timestamps
show this at ~2.4s, a full 1.5s before `"VFS: Mounted root (squashfs filesystem)"` (~4.0s). The file
being correctly packaged doesn't help if `request_firmware()` runs before that filesystem exists.

**Fixed**: `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt"` +
`CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR` (pointing at this repo's own overlay content, always present under `/src`
- this project's own `BUILDROOT_DIR` mount point - by the time the kernel build step runs) embeds
both files directly in the kernel image, sidestepping the rootfs-mount race entirely without touching
the early-manual-insert timing itself (a separate, already-hard-won fix). Real build-time bug hit and
fixed along the way: `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR` must point at the *parent* of the `brcm/` directory,
not `brcm/` itself - the kernel's own Kbuild logic concatenates `DIR` + the full requested name
(which already includes the `brcm/` prefix), and pointing `DIR` at `.../lib/firmware/brcm` produced a
literal `.../brcm/brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin` build failure (`No rule to make target`) on the first
attempt - fixed to point at `.../lib/firmware`.

**Verified on real hardware**: firmware loads.

```
brcmfmac: brcmf_fw_alloc_request: using brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio for chip BCM43430/1
brcmfmac mmc1:0001:1: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.clm_blob failed with error -2
brcmfmac: brcmf_c_process_clm_blob: no clm_blob available (err=-2), device may have limited channels available
brcmfmac: brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds: Firmware: BCM43430/1 wl0: Apr 19 2018 21:18:23 version 7.46.58.13 (r688474 CY) FWID 01-d4334d3d es4.c3.n4
```

The `.clm_blob` request failing is a pre-existing dangling symlink from the Buildroot linux-firmware
package (`brcmfmac43430-sdio.clm_blob -> ../cypress/cyfmac43430-sdio.clm_blob`, target confirmed
absent from this image) - `brcmfmac` itself treats this as non-fatal, exactly as its own decision
tree anticipated (`Case D`), and never asked for it again. **Not chased further** - no evidence it's
required, and the mission's own instruction was explicit: don't add a random CLM file speculatively.

### The second gap: `wlan0` existed but never associated - a real, pre-existing script bug

`wlan0` came up (`brcmf_fw_alloc_request` succeeded, interface visible, real MAC address assigned),
but no association was ever attempted. `scripts/build/overlay/etc/init.d/S39wifi`'s own comment
already documented the correct intent - read real credentials from `/usr/data/wpa_supplicant.conf`,
since `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` is "an unused empty template" (confirmed originally via stock's own
`wpa_supplicant` process's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, sec 18) - but the actual code hardcoded
`CONF=/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`, the exact dead path the comment above it was warning about. **Fixed**:
one-line change to `/usr/data/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

Real, deliberate design constraint surfaced along the way: this custom test image mounts `/usr/data`
as an ephemeral tmpfs, not the real `/dev/mmcblk0p10` (`S01tmpfs-datastore`, sec 24) - a genuine prior
safety decision to keep an untested custom image from ever writing to the real, persistent partition
stock also depends on. That means the real `wpa_supplicant.conf` sitting on that partition isn't
visible to the custom boot by design, not by bug. Rather than weaken that isolation permanently, this
was verified with a manual, one-off, read-only step on the already-running test boot: mount
`/dev/mmcblk0p10` with `-o ro`, copy just that one file into the tmpfs, unmount - the partition was
never opened for writing at any point. This confirms the fix and the real credentials work together,
without deciding a real architecture question (should `/usr/data` become persistent for a production
image?) under real-hardware time pressure - left open, flagged for a real decision later, not resolved
by default.

### Real hardware result: full success

```
# iw dev wlan0 link
Connected to 30:23:03:dc:0b:6b (on wlan0)
	SSID: Office_2.4Ghz
	freq: 2462
	signal: -38 dBm
	rx bitrate: 72.2 MBit/s
	tx bitrate: 24.0 MBit/s

# ip addr show wlan0

    inet 192.168.0.146/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global wlan0
```

Same BSSID and SSID stock's own boot logs have shown throughout this entire investigation. Pinged
from the development host: `3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss`. Real, bidirectional,
working network traffic over Wi-Fi, on the custom Linux 6.6.18-rt23 kernel, on this exact physical
device, for the first time in this project's history.

### Where this leaves things

- **Hardware, firmware, and network stack: all proven working, end to end.** SDHCI command path,
  WL_REG_ON, RTC32K, MSC1 pinmux, PA01, firmware loading, `wlan0`, association, DHCP - every milestone
  this multi-session investigation set out to reach.
- Nine real, isolated commits total across this whole investigation (seven on the fork's `rosetteos`
  branch, sec 49-52; two in this main repo this section) - each independently reviewable, none mixing
  unrelated changes.
- **Real, deliberately-left-open follow-up**: `/usr/data` as ephemeral tmpfs (a real, previously-made
  safety decision, sec 24) means WiFi credentials (and any other `/usr/data` state) don't survive a
  reboot on this test image as it stands - a real product decision, not a bug, and out of scope to
  resolve unilaterally here.
- **Cleanup opportunities, not done here** (real, but secondary to landing the actual fix while
  hardware access was available): `rosetteos_msc1_trace()`'s gated full-detail path already defaults to
  off; the small number of always-on point-in-time `pr_info()` diagnostics added in sec 50-51 (WL_REG_ON
  state, `mmc_of_parse`/`pwrseq` attachment) are cheap (a handful of lines per boot, not a loop) and
  still genuinely useful for the next real hardware cycle - worth trimming in a dedicated pass once this
  is considered fully stable, not bundled into the same commits as the fixes they helped find.

### Real hardware safety record this session

- Three full build/flash/boot/revert cycles this section (firmware packaging, the `CONFIG_EXTRA_
  FIRMWARE` fix, the `S39wifi` fix), all via the spare slot only, all md5-verified before boot.
- The `wpa_supplicant.conf` real-credential step was the one action this session that touched the real
  shared partition at all - and it was a read-only mount (`-o ro`), a single-file copy into ephemeral
  tmpfs, and an immediate unmount. `/dev/mmcblk0p10` was never opened for writing.
- `S00revert-safety` confirmed, every cycle, to have already reverted the ota marker before any manual
  intervention.
- Printer confirmed idle before every reboot. Stock WiFi reassociation confirmed after every cycle.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point.
- Two real, isolated commits this section, in this main repo (not the kernel fork): the firmware-
  packaging mechanism, and the `S39wifi` config-path fix.

## 54. Testing the custom slot end to end - Klipper and Moonraker actually start, four more real bugs
found and fixed (three kernel/build-side, one app-config-side), one already-in-flight app patch
reconciled

WiFi (sec 53) was the headline gap, but never actually proved the rest of the stack (Klipper,
Moonraker) worked - this section rebooted into the custom slot with fresh eyes, found real problems in
both the boot log and the app stack, root-caused each one against real hardware evidence (not guesses),
and didn't stop until Moonraker was genuinely healthy and `S99confirm-good` committed to the custom
slot on its own.

### uart0 vs msc0: real pin conflict, cosmetic in practice, fixed anyway

dmesg showed `pin GPD-23 already requested by 13450000.msc; cannot claim for 10030000.serial` on every
boot. Traced both sides: `msc0_8bit` (the real eMMC, `gpd 17-26`) vs `uart0_pd` (`gpd 23-26`) - a real
overlap. msc0 always won (it's essential, uart0 isn't used by anything in this project - unlike
uart1/uart3/uart4, all documented real links), so nothing actually broke, but the conflict was pure
noise. Fixed by disabling uart0 outright (kernel fork commit `095970ba2`).

### uart3 (Bluetooth) vs i2c4 (touch): real pin conflict, NOT fixed - genuine hardware constraint

Same dmesg pattern, different pins: `GPC-25 already requested by 10054000.i2c; cannot claim for
10033000.serial`. Resolved both pinctrl phandles against the real stock device's own live DTB this time
before touching anything (the mission-brief warning from early in this project about not trusting raw
phandle numbers, still paying off): `uart3-pc` and `i2c4-pc` resolve to the *exact same two physical
pins* (`gpc 25-26`), just different mux function selects. Stock's own real DTB has the identical
dual-claim on both nodes - this is genuine hardware pin-sharing, not a devicetree bug in this project.
Considered moving `&i2c4` to its `i2c4_pd` alternate (`gpd 0-1`) to free the pins for BT, and rejected
it: stock's real DTB never references `i2c4_pd`, only `i2c4_pc`, so there's no confirmation those
alternate pins are physically wired to the NS2009 touch chip on this board - moving it would risk
silently breaking the confirmed-working touchscreen to maybe help BT (never confirmed against real
mainboard hardware at all, per sec 44's own uart3 comment). Documented in place (kernel fork commit
`095970ba2`); touch keeps winning the race, BT stays a known, real, unfixed limitation until someone
implements the same dynamic pin hand-off stock's own `bt_enable_bsa.sh` presumably does at runtime.

### `libstdc++.so.6` missing from every build for days - Klipper died with no log line at all

Real, previously-silent bug, found the moment Klipper actually reached the `import greenlet` line for
the first time: `ImportError: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file`, no log file even opened
(dies before `-l klippy.log` gets created). `BR2_INSTALL_LIBSTDCPP=y` has always been set, and the
library genuinely was built - sitting in the toolchain's own sysroot - but `gcc-final`'s
`.stamp_target_installed` dated back to 19 Jul 10:57, the very first build of this whole project, so
its `INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS` step (the one that actually copies `libstdc++.so*` into the rootfs) never ran
again on any build since. The exact same class of Buildroot stamp-staleness bug this project has now
hit three times (kernel source changes, `wpa_supplicant` Kconfig changes, now the toolchain itself).
Fixed permanently: `03-build-kernel-and-rootfs.sh` now runs `make gcc-final-reinstall` before the main
`make` - cheap (just re-copies already-built libraries, no toolchain rebuild) and makes every future
build immune to this specific staleness class. `06-verify.sh` gained a permanent `libstdc++.so.6`
presence check.

### `zipp` missing - Moonraker died with no log line either, right after the libstdc++ fix let it get further

Same silent-death pattern, one import deeper: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'zipp'`.
`importlib_metadata` (a real Moonraker dependency, downloaded with `--no-deps` in
`04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh`) imports `zipp` at runtime, but `--no-deps` meant it was never actually
fetched. Fixed by adding `zipp==3.20.2` to the same pip download line. This prompted a full audit of
every other `--no-deps`-downloaded package's real transitive dependencies (`apprise`, `ldap3`,
`libnacl`, `inotify-simple`, `preprocess-cancellation`) against their actual `Requires-Dist` metadata -
all already satisfied by other Buildroot-provided packages (`certifi`/`requests`/`click`/`markdown`/
`PyYAML` for `apprise`; `pyasn1` for `ldap3`; `libsodium.so` for `libnacl`) or genuinely dependency-free.
Two *latent* (not currently triggered - config-gated, only load if `moonraker.conf` ever gains a
`[zeroconf]` or `[mqtt]` section) version mismatches noted but not chased: Buildroot's bundled
`zeroconf` (0.39.4) and `paho-mqtt` (1.6.1) both trail what Moonraker's own `moonraker-requirements.txt`
actually wants (`>=0.131.0` and `==2.1.0` respectively - the 1.x/2.x paho-mqtt gap is a known breaking
API change).

### `numpy` - not a bug, but a real completeness gap, fixed proactively

`shaper_calibrate.py` only raises a clean, user-facing `command_error` if `numpy` is missing (not a
crash), and only when a user actually invokes resonance/input-shaper calibration - so this was never
blocking anything. But input-shaper calibration is close to a universal step for any real Klipper
setup, `numpy` is a ready, arch-supported Buildroot package
(`BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_NUMPY_ARCH_SUPPORTS=y`), and cross-compiling it isn't the BLAS/LAPACK-dependent
ordeal `scipy` would be - so it's enabled now rather than left as a day-one surprise for whoever first
tries `MEASURE_AXES_NOISE`/`SHAPER_CALIBRATE`. `scipy` (used only by Klipper's optional `sos_filter`/
`probe_eddy_ng` extras, neither referenced in this printer's real `printer.cfg`) was left alone -
genuinely irrelevant to this hardware (BLTouch, not eddy-current), not worth the bigger cross-compile
risk for zero current benefit.

### The real root cause of `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` - `CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING` was off in the kernel

The deepest find of this session. Moonraker's database component failed on its *very first* sqlite
open - single process, brand-new file, zero real contention - with `database is locked`. Reproduced the
same failure with a bare, minimal Python script, then with raw `flock()`/`fcntl(F_SETLK)` calls on a
throwaway file in `/tmp`: `flock()` returned `ENOSYS`, `fcntl(F_SETLK)` returned `EACCES`, both on an
utterly uncontended file. `:memory:` sqlite worked fine, ruling out the Python binding/library itself.
Checked the built kernel's own `.config`: `# CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING is not set` - inherited from the base
`x2000_halley5_v30_linux` vendor defconfig (almost certainly a kernel-size trim on Ingenic's part, not
a deliberate choice for this project), silently disabling POSIX advisory locking kernel-wide. This
would have broken *any* future component depending on `flock`/`fcntl` locks, not just Moonraker's
sqlite usage - a systemic gap, not a narrow one. Fixed with one line in
`halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`: `CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING=y`. `06-verify.sh` gained a permanent check.

Independently, and in parallel, a `moonraker-sqlite-nolock.patch` had already been added to
`04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh` - a real, working, application-level fix for the exact same symptom
(root-caused via `strace` down to the same `fcntl64(F_SETLK64, PENDING_BYTE)` = `EACCES` call, and
worked around with SQLite's own documented `nolock=1` URI parameter, safe here since this database is
private to a single Moonraker process). Both fixes are real and both stay - they don't conflict: the
kernel fix restores real locking system-wide, and Moonraker's own connections simply don't need to rely
on it, which is harmless for a private, single-process database. The patch step itself had a real
robustness gap - `patch`'s own idempotent-reapplication exit code, combined with `set -e`, could abort
the whole script even when the file was already correctly patched - fixed with `patch -N ... || true`
so repeat builds stay safe either way.

### `S99confirm-good` never flipped the marker forward - not a crash, an auth config gap

With every fix above in place, Moonraker's own `/server/info` endpoint started returning a real,
healthy JSON body - but `wget`-ed from `127.0.0.1`, it came back `401 Unauthorized` instead, since
`moonraker.conf`'s `trusted_clients` only listed `192.168.0.0/16` and `10.0.0.0/8`, neither of which
covers loopback. `S99confirm-good`'s own health check greps for `"result"` in the response body, which
a 401 never has - so it kept declaring Moonraker unhealthy and leaving the ota marker on stock, even
though the server was fully up. Fixed by adding `127.0.0.1` to `trusted_clients` - a one-line,
standard-practice addition any real local Moonraker setup would want anyway.

### Real, permanent build-script robustness fixes made along the way

- **`vendor/buildroot-x2000/board/halley5-nebulaos-overlay` ownership**: `02-configure-buildroot.sh`'s
  own `cp -r` of the overlay runs inside a `--user root` container, leaving the tree root-owned; the
  very next stage (`04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh`) writes into that same tree as the host user and
  failed with `Permission denied` on a rebuild. `02-configure-buildroot.sh` now hands the overlay tree
  back to the host user (`chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g)`) as its own last step, so this can't regress.
- Build-stage exclusive lock (`.nebulaos-build.lock`, `flock`) added across `02`-`05` to stop two build
  stages from interleaving writes into the same shared `vendor/buildroot-x2000` tree if run
  concurrently.
- `build-work/` (04's own pywheels/tarball scratch dir) added to `.gitignore` - pure build output, same
  reasoning as `vendor/`.

### Final verified state, real hardware, this section

```
wget http://127.0.0.1:7125/server/info
{"result":{"klippy_connected":true,"klippy_state":"startup", ...
 "components":[...,"database",...], "failed_components":["machine"], ...}}

dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=1 count=16 2>/dev/null   # the raw ota marker
ota:kernel2
```

`failed_components: ["machine"]` is expected and benign - that component needs
`org.freedesktop.systemd1` over D-Bus, and this is a deliberately systemd-free BusyBox/Buildroot
target. Everything else, including `database`, loaded clean. Klipper itself still stops short of fully
running - `configparser.Error: Option 'z_offset' in section 'bltouch' must be specified` - but that's a
real, expected, physical bed-leveling calibration value every BLTouch-equipped Klipper setup needs from
its actual owner, not a build or kernel bug; Klipper now gets all the way to real config parsing, which
is as far as software alone can take it.

**The `ota` marker read back `ota:kernel2` after a real reboot** - `S99confirm-good` independently
confirmed Moonraker healthy and committed to the custom slot on its own, unprompted, for the first time
in this project's history. WiFi re-verified working on this exact build too (`wpa_state=COMPLETED`,
real DHCP lease, reachable by `ssh` and `wget` from an external host).

### Real hardware safety record this section

- Every reboot preceded by a live `print_stats` idle check; every image write through
  `flash-spare-slot.sh`'s own md5 verification; spare slot only, never `p5`/`p7`.
- No `insmod`/`rmmod` of `cywdhd.ko`/`soc_msc.ko` at any point.
- The one write to the real shared partition (`/dev/mmcblk0p10`) was the same read-only-mount,
  single-file, immediate-unmount `wpa_supplicant.conf` copy as sec 53 - repeated each boot since
  `/usr/data` is tmpfs and doesn't persist (a known, already-documented, deliberate tradeoff, sec 24).
- Two real, isolated commits so far this section: the kernel fork's uart0/BT documentation commit
  (`095970ba2`), plus this main-repo commit bundling the build-script and config fixes above.

## 55. Stock-parity / board-port audit - two real pin conflicts found and fixed, four bounded investigations closed

A systematic audit of the whole board, not just WiFi: prove the custom kernel configures every SoC
pin/peripheral safely and consistently with stock, without requiring the (still disconnected)
printer mainboard. Full detail lives in dedicated docs rather than here, since the raw data (register
dumps, DTB diffs) is large:

```
docs/STOCK_PARITY_MATRIX.md
docs/DTB_PARITY_REPORT.md
docs/PIN_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md
docs/PRINTER_MAINBOARD_PRECONNECTION_CHECKLIST.md
scripts/parity/capture-state.sh
artifacts/parity/{baseline,stock,custom}/
```

### Baseline frozen first

Tagged `baseline-stock-parity-audit-start` in both this repo and the kernel fork before any
exploratory work, with artifact hashes and a full serial verification log
(`artifacts/parity/baseline/`) - nothing from this investigation gets mixed into that reference
point.

### Method

Captured the same read-only inventory (`/proc`, `/sys`, `lsusb`, `iw`, debugfs
gpio/pinctrl/clk/regulator/mmc/dma) on stock and custom at a comparable boot stage, decompiled the
*exact packaged* custom DTB (not just source DTS) and diffed it against a real stock live device
tree, then cross-referenced every disputed pin's DT intent against its *live* claim state - DT
equivalence doesn't prove equivalent hardware state, and this caught real, live-only differences DT
comparison alone would have missed entirely.

### Two real, active pin conflicts found and fixed (each its own commit + full rebuild/reflash/verify cycle)

- **`uart1` (the printer MCU link) vs. `lcd_vdd_en`**: custom claimed a 4-pin group (`GPC-21..24`)
  where stock's real, running firmware only ever claims 2 (`GPC-23`/`24`). `GPC-21` was
  *simultaneously* claimed by `uart1`'s alt-function and by `lcd_vdd_en` (the LCD power-enable line)
  as a plain GPIO output - a genuine, active, live conflict, not hypothetical, harmless so far only
  because Klipper's MCU protocol doesn't use hardware flow control. Fixed with a new board-local
  2-pin group (`uart1_pc_txrx`, kernel fork commit `970bd6b83`) matching stock exactly. This was the
  headline blocker in the printer-mainboard preconnection checklist - **now cleared**.
- **`MSC2`**: inherited Halley5 reference-board config with no stock usage and no known physical SD
  slot. Its `ingenic,sdr-gpio` property claimed `GPC-0` - the exact same pin `pwm0`/backlight uses
  for its only real PWM alternate function on this SoC, confirmed structurally (not just "no card
  responds") by cross-referencing the packaged DTB's own phandles against live debugfs GPIO state.
  Disabled (kernel fork commit `72236226a`). Verified: `mmc2` no longer probes, `GPC-0`/`GPC-12` both
  return to fully unclaimed. One useful negative result along the way: the pre-existing
  `gpiod_set_value_cansleep: invalid GPIO (errorpointer)` dmesg warnings are **unchanged** by this
  fix, proving - not assuming - they were never MSC2-related.

Both fixes verified with a full rebuild → flash spare slot → reboot → live pinctrl/GPIO re-capture →
WiFi/Moonraker/SQLite/`S99confirm-good` health check cycle. Zero regressions either time.

### Four bounded, read-only investigations closed (no pin driven, no destructive test, one stock reboot)

- **`spi_gpio`/`spi2.0`**: bound to generic `spidev` via the well-known `rohm,dh2228fv` placeholder
  compatible, root-only `/dev/spidev2.0`. Classified `FACTORY_TEST_DEVICE` (moderate confidence) -
  real, bound child device, not vendor-DT residue, but no specific consumer binary confirmed.
- **`bt_reg_on` (`GPD-5`)**: stock's `rfkill list` shows a real, unblocked Bluetooth device and live
  `btudpwork`/`btfwwork` kernel firmware-loading threads, alongside a steady `out hi` GPIO state.
  Classified `BT_POWER_REQUIRED` (high confidence) - a real gap on custom, independent of the
  already-known `uart3`/`i2c4` pin-sharing issue, but not implemented (needs its own polarity/
  ordering/delay proposal first).
- **`uart5`/`6`/`7`**: reclassified `STOCK_ENABLED_BUT_UNUSED` → `STOCK_ENABLED_PURPOSE_UNKNOWN` per
  the mission's own correction (a disconnected mainboard proves nothing about *why* stock wires
  these). None appear in `/proc/interrupts` (IRQ only requested on `open()`, so this means
  never-opened this session, not non-functional) but all three `/dev/ttyS5-7` nodes exist and are
  correctly driver-bound.
- **eFuse**: `/dev/efuse-string-version` is a real, `ioctl`-gated misc device (plain `read()` returns
  `EINVAL`) - the access pattern of a genuine, purpose-built consumer, but no consumer binary
  positively identified. `CONFIG_INGENIC_EFUSE_X2000` stays disabled, per the mission's own stated
  default when a required consumer isn't proven.

### A real bug in this project's own tooling, found and fixed along the way

`bluetoothctl show` hangs indefinitely with no TTY on stock's BusyBox (no `timeout` applet to bound
it with) - `scripts/parity/capture-state.sh`'s `run()` helper now wraps every capture in a portable
background+watchdog timeout instead of trusting the tool to return.

### Real hardware safety record this section

- Every reboot preceded by a live `print_stats` idle check (the printer mainboard stayed disconnected
  throughout, so this only confirms Moonraker/Klipper state, not a physical print).
- Every image write went through `flash-spare-slot.sh`'s own md5 verification; spare slot only.
- One real scp-timeout bug caught before it caused harm: a 55MB rootfs transfer got killed mid-flight
  by an over-tight wrapper timeout, leaving a truncated file on stock - caught by comparing file sizes
  *before* flashing, not after, and fixed by re-copying with a longer timeout and explicit
  post-transfer size verification.
- One real process-hygiene mistake, self-corrected: a `03-build-kernel-and-rootfs.sh` run was
  interrupted, but its `docker run` container kept running independently of the killed shell wrapper,
  holding `.nebulaos-build.lock` - found and stopped explicitly (`docker stop`) before the next build.
- Five isolated commits this section: `970bd6b83` (uart1 fix), `72236226a` (MSC2 disable), plus three
  main-repo doc commits (Phase 0/1 baseline+inventory, Phase 2/3A/10A findings, this section's fixes
  and bounded investigations).

## 56. Printer-port parity audit using software-only stock equivalence - gate reaches PASS, no instrument required

Continuation of §55, explicitly scoped this time to prove *software-visible* equivalence (pin-
controller, GPIO-register, clock, reset, UART-register, driver-ownership boundary) for the printer
MCU link, given no oscilloscope/multimeter/logic analyzer is available - accepting PCB routing and
analog voltage from the known-working stock design rather than independently re-measuring it.

### Register-level and clock identity confirmed bit-for-bit

`/sys/class/tty/ttyS1/*` matched exactly between stock and custom: `uartclk=150000000`, `irq=54`,
`iomem_base=0x10031000`, `io_type=2`, `type=1`. Raw `devmem` reads of the LCR register showed
`0x00000013` (8N1) on both systems once the port was opened - on custom via a deliberate
`stty -F /dev/ttyS1 -a` query (opens/queries termios without transmitting arbitrary data, per this
pass's own safety rule); on stock, the value was already present *before we touched anything*,
traced to stock's own `S13mcu_update` init script opening the port automatically at boot.

### The printer MCU link identity, proven from stock's own firmware, not inferred

`/etc/init.d/S13mcu_update` selects `mcu0_serial=/dev/ttyS1` for board `NEBULA V1.0.0.1` model
`F005` - both confirmed matching this exact device via `get_sn_mac.sh`. This is stock's own official
answer to "what is uart1 for", not a guess from pin geometry. Its handshake tool (`mcu_util -i
/dev/ttyS1 -c`) ran automatically during the stock capture (no mainboard attached) and failed with a
clean protocol timeout (`/tmp/mcu_update.log`: `select time out` → `handshake ... fail, ret=1`), not
a hang or fault - direct, real-hardware proof that "no mainboard connected" is a normal, gracefully
handled condition in the known-good reference firmware, which is exactly the state this bench setup
is in. `strings`/grep search of `mcu_util` and its caller found no reset/boot/enable GPIO reference
at all - stock's own tooling uses no separate hardware reset pin for this MCU, closing that open
question as `NO_SOFTWARE_CONTROL_SIGNAL_IDENTIFIED` (confirmed absent, not merely unfound).

### Voltage domain closed without a multimeter

`GPC` (uart1's bank) has no software-configurable voltage property at all: `pinctrl-ingenic.c`
(`module_drivers/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-ingenic.c:1966-1992`) only ever parses `ingenic,gpa_voltage`
and `ingenic,gpe_msc_voltage` by hardcoded name - no `gpc_voltage` property exists in the driver for
any other bank. `GPC`'s I/O voltage is a fixed hardware characteristic on this SoC; stock and custom
structurally cannot diverge here regardless of DTS content, closing this gate criterion by reading
driver source, not by measuring anything.

### Gate reassessment

`docs/PRINTER_MAINBOARD_PRECONNECTION_CHECKLIST.md` now reads
`CONNECTION_GATE_PASS_SOFTWARE_EQUIVALENCE` for the SoC-side `uart1` signal path: pin-controller
ownership, register semantics, clock/IRQ/MMIO identity, voltage-domain determinism, and
protocol/purpose identity all confirmed matching stock. No printer-facing pin remains classified
`CUSTOM_REGRESSION`. Two items explicitly remain outside this gate's proof boundary and are **not**
resolved by it: physical connector pinout (which harness pin is which signal - a documentation
question, not a software one) and the explicit human sign-off this project has committed to
requiring before any physical mainboard connection, gate status notwithstanding.

### Real hardware safety record this section

- Two more full stock↔custom reboot cycles, each using each system's own native OTA mechanism
  (custom's `write_ota_marker` helper; stock's own `ota_local_method.sh`'s `local_set_next_boot_device`
  toggle, since stock's rootfs has no `write_ota_marker.sh` of its own) - marker read back via `dd`
  and verified before every reboot, matching this project's now-standard practice.
- No data transmitted on `uart1` beyond a single `stty -F -a` termios query (opens/queries only,
  never writes to the wire) - stayed within this pass's explicit "no arbitrary data on an unverified
  line" rule throughout.
- `S99confirm-good` re-confirmed clean on the return trip to custom - zero regressions from the
  earlier §55 fixes.

## 57. Final cleanup mission: ASoC mux topology, speaker-enable path, UART3/Bluetooth Path A, MScaler, TCU logging, and exact wireless-blob provenance - four real fixes plus a bonus resolution, all verified live

Closing pass over the remaining boot-log items from the ongoing audit: the LO0-LO11_MUX ASoC
warnings, the GPIO 34/`Speaker_en` control's real role, UART3's guaranteed-fail pinctrl claim, both
MScaler instances, TCU's optional trigger-IRQ log severity, and (definitively, this time) the exact
provenance of the CLM/TxCap wireless blobs.

### Dead vendor code, found and enabled: LO_MUX warnings gone

`as-dsp.c`'s DAPM widget construction had `dapm_widgets[i].kcontrol_news`/`.num_kcontrols` wrapped in
`#if 0`/`#endif` - already-correct, already-sized kcontrol wiring (`lomux_enum[]`/`lomux_controls[]`,
`LOMUX_SOC_DAPM_ENUM_EXT(0)`-`(15)`) that mainline's stricter `dapm_new_mux()` (which requires
`num_kcontrols == 1` for `snd_soc_dapm_mux` widgets) was rejecting outright. Removed the dead-code
wrapper (`4579e3803`). Confirmed via DT that `as_fe_dsp`'s `ingenic,lo-port = <0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11>` matches the observed 12-warning count exactly. Live, post-reflash: the "incorrect number of
controls" messages are completely gone. A new, different, and expected message appeared in their
place (`mux LOn_MUX has no paths`, standard DAPM informational severity) - this just means the mux
widgets are now correctly registered but have no routes wired to them, a separate and harmless
pre-existing condition, not a regression from this fix.

### GPIO 34/`Speaker_en`: real software, hardware presence still unconfirmed - left alone

Traced both DTS occurrences of `ingenic,spken-gpio = <&gpb 2 ...>` to their actual consumers:
`&icodec`'s copy is dead (the compiled codec driver, `icdc_inno.c` v1, never reads this property -
only the uncompiled v2 does); the `sound` node's copy is live, read by this board's own machine
driver (`halley5_v20.c`) and wired to a real ALSA "Speaker Enable" control. Live boot log confirms
exactly one clean claim, no conflict: `Speaker enable pin(34) request ok`. Stock's own live DTB has
zero speaker/sound nodes and no stock init script touches ALSA, but stock is a different kernel
generation that could plausibly configure audio outside devicetree, so this isn't conclusive either
way. No boot-log symptom drives a change here, and no PCB-level evidence was available to confirm or
rule out a real amp/speaker on this SKU. Classified `UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_PCB_EVIDENCE`, DTS left
unchanged - per this mission's own rule against disabling a real product function without evidence.
Confirmed independent of the already-proven PWM beeper (different GPIO bank, bypasses ALSA entirely).

### UART3: Path A taken, guaranteed-fail noise eliminated

`uart3_pc` (`GPC-25/26`) is the same physical pin group as `i2c4_pc` (touch), a real hardware
pin-sharing design already fully investigated in an earlier pass - touch always wins the static
devicetree race, so `uart3` in its "okay" state was *guaranteed*, not merely likely, to fail its own
pinctrl claim every single boot. Since a real Bluetooth transport (Path B) would require stock's own
dynamic runtime pin hand-off mechanism, a substantially larger effort outside this pass's scope, Path
A was taken: `uart3` disabled (`51b8ecedd`), all prior investigation preserved verbatim in the DTS
comment. Live: zero `uart3`/`GPC-25`/`10033000.serial` matches anywhere in the post-boot log.

### Both MScaler instances disabled: reference-design block, zero consumer

`mscaler0`/`mscaler1` register only as `v4l2_subdev` ISP-pipeline components, not `/dev/videoN`
capture devices - confirmed zero userspace consumer anywhere on the rootfs (grepped live for
"mscaler"/`VIDIOC` usage) and no `mscaler`-specific node under `/sys/class/video4linux`. The real,
working camera path (USB UVC via `ustreamer`) and rotation/H.264 encode/decode (`/dev/video0-2`,
separate SoC blocks) are unaffected. Both disabled (`69d8655d0`). Live: zero `mscaler` matches
anywhere in the post-boot log; rotation/encode/decode still register exactly as before.

### TCU trigger-IRQ: severity fixed, not a real error

Verified via source read that `ret` (set from the failed, optional second `platform_get_irq(pdev,
1)`) is unconditionally overwritten a few lines later by the *primary*, always-present IRQ's
`request_irq()` result before it's ever checked - this optional trigger-mode IRQ has zero effect on
probe success or failure, confirming the prior `dev_err` was cosmetically wrong. Downgraded to
`dev_info` with an accurate message (`5ac124ac6`). Live: `no trigger-mode IRQ (optional, not used by
this board)` now appears in place of the old `not support irq trigger function` error-level line.

### CLM/TxCap: conclusively closed, confirmed absent from stock itself

Extracted stock's actual rootfs from a full raw device backup (`vendor/device-backups/
nebula_system_backup.bin`) using only userspace tools - `sgdisk -p` read the GPT even from a truncated
backup file (main header intact), `dd` pulled partition 7 (`rootfs`, real Squashfs, 500MiB) out
directly, `unsquashfs` listed and selectively extracted files with no root/mount required. SHA256
confirmed our currently-deployed `brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin`/`.txt` are byte-identical to stock's own
`cyw43438-7.46.58.13.bin`/`nvram_azw372.txt`. Stock's own `S43wifi_bcm_init_config`/`S44wifi_bcm_up`
contain zero "clm"/"txcap" references, and no such file exists anywhere in stock's shipped rootfs.
This closes the question definitively as "confirmed absent upstream," not "not yet found" - per the
mission's own provenance-priority framework, no public/generic-chip-family candidate was ever
installed, since none would be proven to originate from this exact device.

### Wi-Fi premature scan: reaffirmed, unchanged

`mmc1: Failed to initialize a non-removable card` remains classified `KNOWN_BENIGN_PREPOWER_SCAN` -
already established and tracked; the manual, power-sequenced insert immediately afterward always
succeeds. No new work needed; re-confirmed present and unchanged in this pass's own live capture.

### Bonus: the GPD-4/BAIC4 pin conflict, root-caused two missions ago, is now actually gone

The earlier boot-cleanup mission root-caused (via temporary instrumentation) but deliberately left
unfixed a real two-device pin conflict: `&as_be_baic`'s `pinctrl-0 = <&baic4_pd>` claim covered
`GPD-4`/`GPD-5`, the same pins `wlan_reg_on`/`bt_reg_on` use as plain GPIO, producing a full backtrace
on every boot (harmless - both devices worked regardless - but noisy). The separate BAIC4/DMIC
investigation (§ see `docs/BAIC4_AUDIO_INVESTIGATION.md`) removed that pinctrl claim entirely for an
unrelated reason (BAIC4's DAI links were confirmed unreachable dead references), and this pass's live
verification is the first confirmation that it also closed the pin conflict as a side effect: a full
post-boot `dmesg` (234 lines) on the rebuilt image has zero matches for `redefinition`,
`used_pins_bitmap`, `GPD`, `conflict`, `already requested`, `Call Trace`, or `backtrace`.

### Full build/flash/validate cycle, real hardware

Built via the standard `02` through `06` pipeline (`06-verify.sh`'s own `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` check
was a stale exact-string match left over from before the regulatory.db/board-alias work landed -
tightened to a prefix match rather than leaving a permanent false alarm in the project's own tooling).
Manifest: `git_commit_kernel=69d8655d0`, `git_dirty_kernel=no` - confirms the build used exactly the
four new commits, nothing uncommitted. Found the device already sitting on the *custom* slot
(`/dev/mmcblk0p8`) from an earlier session's validated build - flipped the OTA marker back to stock,
rebooted, confirmed `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7`/`Linux 4.4.94`, transferred the new images over `scp`,
flashed the spare slot (`flash-spare-slot.sh`, manifest-verified size+SHA256 on both files before any
write, md5 write-back verified after), flipped the marker forward, rebooted into the new build.
Confirmed live: `git_commit_kernel` timestamp in `uname -a` matches the new build exactly; all four
target fixes present and correct; the bonus GPD-4/BAIC4 resolution; zero regressions across eMMC (all
10 partitions), WiFi (firmware loads, real chip version string), ALSA (`halley5_v30` card registers),
display/rotation/encode/decode, touch (`ns2009_ts`), RTC, watchdog, PWM, USB, the PWM beeper
(`guppybeep click`, RC=0), and the full app stack (Klipper connected, Moonraker `/server/info`
responding, GuppyScreen running). `S99confirm-good` had already flipped the marker forward on its own
by the time validation began, confirming the app stack was detected healthy without intervention.

## 58. Functional production-baseline mission: booting stock to settle the ALSA question for good, disabling the whole unused audio graph, and a second off-by-one found by its own twin

Closing pass explicitly scoped to a *functional* production baseline (not manufacturing/reliability/
security hardening): one clean build, one verified flash, one reboot, one complete smoke test - not
another open-ended investigation cycle.

### Phase 0-1: freeze the baseline, then answer the ALSA question directly instead of guessing again

Tagged the prior mission's validated state on both repos (`baseline-2026-07-23-cleanup-mission`)
before touching anything. Then, rather than keep treating GPIO 34/BAIC0/icodec as an open question,
booted the *exact stock firmware* and checked directly: `dmesg` says `ALSA device list: No soundcards
found.` verbatim, `/proc/asound/cards` says `--- no soundcards ---`, `/proc/asound/pcm` is empty, and
`/dev/snd` contains only the generic ALSA sequencer timer (card-independent, always present). Stock
does ship a real, carefully-tuned volume-control script (`/usr/bin/audio_setting.sh`, real dB-step
arrays) and a dedicated `audio-server` binary that references it - but `audio-server` is not running,
is not started by any `/etc/init.d/S*` script, and stock's actual production stack is Klipper +
GuppyScreen (`S55klipper_service`, `S56moonraker_service`, `S99guppyscreen`) - the whole `app-server`/
`audio-server`/`display-server`/`master-server`/`web-server`/`wifi-server` family is inactive
legacy-reference code from an earlier internal architecture, present on the shared rootfs image but
never wired into this product's own boot sequence. Presence on disk is not evidence of use.

### Phase 2: the whole PCM/ALSA graph disabled, GPIO 34 closed as a side effect

Disabled `as-platform`, `as-virtual-fe`, `as-fmtcov`, `as-dsp`, `as-baic`, `as-dmic`, `as-mixer`,
`as-spdif`, `icodec`, and the top-level `sound` machine-driver node (`0ad06fa0e`) - the complete
dependency graph, not just the card entry point, so no component driver probes at all anymore. This
also closes GPIO 34/`Speaker_en` (previously `UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_PCB_EVIDENCE`): the `sound` node's
`ingenic,spken-gpio` property was its only live consumer (confirmed earlier that `icodec`'s own copy
of the same property was already dead - the compiled `icdc_inno.c` v1 driver never reads it), so the
pin is no longer requested at all. The PWM beeper (`GPC-3`, `guppybeep`, direct `/dev/mem` MMIO) needs
none of this and is entirely unaffected - confirmed live post-reboot (`guppybeep click` → RC=0).

### Phase 3: a real off-by-one, found once, then found again by its own twin

Root-caused `parse cpu-ost-iomap, ost number define in dt is too large!`: `ingenic_core_ost.c` parses
`cpu-ost-map` as a flat u32 array into pairs, incrementing an index and checking `index > NR_CPUS * 2
- 1` *after* storing each value. For this board's fully correct, minimal DT (`<0 0x000>, <1 0x100>` -
exactly `NR_CPUS` (2) pairs), that check fires on the post-increment value of the *last legitimate*
entry, after every real value was already stored correctly - a genuine off-by-one, not excess DT data
(removing an entry would have broken CPU1's timer). Fixed by checking the target pair index against
the real `cpu_ost_map[NR_CPUS]` array bound *before* writing, not after the fact against a flat value
count - strictly safer for a genuinely-oversized DT too (the original could perform one out-of-bounds
write before its own check caught up).

The very next full boot-log review (required by this mission's own Phase 7, "one complete boot-log
review") turned up a second, previously-unnoticed instance of the identical pattern: `parse
cpu-intc-iomap, intc define in dt is too large!`, in the interrupt controller driver
(`irq-ingenic-chip.c`), parsing `cpu-intc-map` into `cpu_intc_map[NR_CPUS]` with byte-for-byte the
same off-by-one. Same fix applied (`e123bb14f`). Both messages are gone in the final boot log.

### Phase 4: DT capability assertions added to the verify pipeline

`06-verify.sh` now decompiles the real, packaged, fully-resolved production DTB (via the `dtc` host
tool Buildroot already builds - no Docker/network needed) and asserts every intentionally-disabled
reference-design block (`mac1`, `msc2`, `sfc`, both MScalers, `uart3`, and now the whole PCM/ALSA
graph) stays disabled, and every required product device (eMMC, WiFi SDIO, `uart1`, `uart4` console,
touch, display, PWM/beeper, USB, RTC, watchdog) stays enabled - checking the real compiled artifact
rather than reimplementing DTS override-precedence against the layered source. Catches a future
accidental status flip at verify time instead of on a live boot.

### Phases 5-6: reaffirmed, no new work needed

CLM/TxCap: already conclusively closed (confirmed absent from stock's own shipped rootfs, not merely
unfound). TCU trigger-IRQ: already downgraded to `dev_info` in an earlier pass, reaffirmed unchanged.
`pdmam` IRQ, jitterentropy, USB dummy regulators, static GPIO base allocation, IRQ affinity warning,
alternate GPT: all already correctly documented as accepted, harmless, architecture-level
characteristics with zero product impact - no code changes needed or made.

### Phase 7: one real build/flash/reboot/smoke-test cycle (two, once the second off-by-one was found)

Built via the standard `02`-`06` pipeline, `06-verify.sh` 100% clean both times (zero MISS lines,
including all new DTB assertions). Found the device already on the custom slot from the prior
mission - cycled to stock, transferred the new images, flashed the spare slot (manifest-verified
size+SHA256 before write, md5 write-back verified after), flipped the marker, rebooted. The
boot-log review then surfaced the `cpu-intc-map` twin bug, so - rather than freeze a baseline with a
known, understood, but unapplied fix - did one more complete cycle: fixed it, rebuilt, reflashed,
rebooted a second time. Final smoke test: eMMC (10 partitions), WiFi SDIO + real firmware version
string, USB, display/touch/rotation/encode/decode, RTC, watchdog, PWM beeper (RC=0), Klipper
connected to Moonraker, GuppyScreen running, `S99confirm-good` already flipped the marker forward on
its own (confirming the app stack was detected healthy without intervention), fallback metadata
intact. Final boot-log review: zero stack traces, zero GPIO conflicts, zero failed mandatory probes,
zero repeated deferred-probe churn, `ALSA device list: No soundcards found.` byte-for-byte matching
stock, both "too large" messages gone. See `docs/BOOT_WARNING_AUDIT.md`'s final-gate note and
`docs/BOARD_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` for the complete capability disposition.

### Real hardware safety record this section

- A serial-automation script bug (marker-detection matching the shell's local echo of the typed
  command instead of only its actual output) caused a boot-completion poll to spin silently for
  longer than it should have - caught, root-caused, and fixed mid-session, not worked around.
- Every reboot cycle used the project's own established mechanisms (`write_ota_marker`,
  `flash-spare-slot.sh`'s own manifest/size/SHA256/md5 verification chain, never touching the
  currently-booted slot) - no ad-hoc partition writes.
- Classification: **`FUNCTIONAL_PRODUCTION_BASELINE`** - explicitly not manufacturing-qualified,
  reliability-validated, security-hardened, or Bluetooth-complete. See
  `docs/BOARD_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`.

## 59. GUI workstream: display and touch root-cause fixes, functional GUI baseline

Closing pass for display quality and touch input - the two remaining userspace-facing defects left
open at the kernel handoff. Both root-caused and fixed with direct hardware evidence, not guessed;
one guessed intermediate (display bus mode, twice) was tested and reverted before the real value was
obtained by reading it directly off stock's own running hardware.

### Display: RGB565, proven from stock's own live register, not guessed

The panel driver had defaulted to `TFT_LCD_MODE_PARALLEL_888`, an explicitly unconfirmed assumption
flagged in the driver's own header comment since it was first written. Two isolated experiments
(`PARALLEL_666` alone, then `PARALLEL_666` with the reference template's own dithering) were tested
and reverted - both produced a color tint or a different, still-wrong artifact, not a fix. Rather
than guess a third bus width, cache/DMA coherency and DPU FIFO/underrun were ruled out first with
live evidence (a full-frame-rewrite experiment while GuppyScreen ran physically changed nothing; the
DPU's own interrupt counters showed zero underruns across tens of thousands of real interrupts with
GuppyScreen active), then the real `DC_TFT_CFG` register was read directly off stock while it was
booted and running (`devmem 0x13059010 32` → `0x00000102`, decoding to `MODE=0b010=PARALLEL_565`
under this driver's own `dpu_reg.h` bitfield definitions). Custom's own live read of the same
register (`0x00000000`, matching its then-current `PARALLEL_888` config exactly) validated the read
methodology before trusting the stock value. Setting `PARALLEL_565` was physically confirmed fixed:
grain removed, gradients smooth, blended content and text clean, matching stock.

GPIO 85/PC21 (the earlier, separately-confirmed dark-panel fix) was frozen and not reopened. Two
other real register divergences found along the way - `DC_SYNC_DL` (stock=1, custom=0) and a
separate CGU pixel-clock-inversion bit at physical `0x10000064` bit 26 (stock=1, custom=0) - were
deliberately left untouched: the display was already fixed, and changing a working configuration
solely for register parity would only add risk.

### Touch: the kernel driver generated zero coordinate events, root-caused via disassembly of stock's real driver

The reported symptom (touch wakes the display but never activates on-screen controls) turned out to
undersell the real defect. A native diagnostic tool (`inputdiag`, built with this project's own MIPS
toolchain) proved custom's touch driver generated *zero* raw coordinate events even with GuppyScreen
fully stopped and no other process holding the device open - not a mapping or calibration problem,
a complete absence of events. Temporary rate-limited kernel instrumentation showed why: the generic
upstream `ns2009.c` driver gates touch detection on the NS2009 chip's Z1 pressure ADC channel, which
reads exactly `0` on every single poll on this real board regardless of touch state.

Pulling and disassembling stock's closed `ns2009_touch.ko` (relocation-verified, not string-guessed)
showed a completely different architecture: interrupt-driven via `gpio_to_desc(79)` →
`gpiod_to_irq()` → `devm_request_threaded_irq()`, corroborated by a real `Unbalanced enable for IRQ
74` kernel warning captured live during stock's own `ns2009_open()` earlier in this project's own
history. Stock's I2C read commands for X/Y were byte-identical to custom's - only the press-detection
mechanism differed. GPIO 79 decodes to GPIOC pin 15 under this project's own established
`bank*32+pin` convention (the same one that identified GPIO 85 as PC21).

Added an optional `pendown-gpios` DT property (`&gpc 15`, active-low) and modified `ns2009.c` to gate
touch detection on it when present, falling back to the original Z1-only behavior unchanged for any
other board using this driver. A live register snapshot during a confirmed touch initially showed no
change and the fix was reverted as a false negative - but the actual GuppyScreen behavior (not yet
checked at that point) was already correct on that exact build. Re-tested against the real
acceptance criterion (does GuppyScreen respond accurately) rather than trusting the diagnostic
snapshot alone, confirmed working, and re-applied. Physically validated twice: all four corners and
center activate accurately, matching stock, both on the initial fix and again on the final build
after removing the temporary diagnostic logging.

A separate, real bug was also found and fixed along the way: custom's `guppyconfig.json` touch
calibration coefficients were wildly wrong (magnitudes 9-380x off stock's), corrected to match
stock's proven values via a verified backup and atomic write. This alone did not fix touch - the
deeper defect was zero events reaching userspace at all - but is a necessary, low-risk correction now
that real events flow.

### Real hardware safety record this section

- Every register read used `devmem` against MMIO bases and offsets proven from this project's own
  driver source (`dpu_reg.h`, `pinctrl-ingenic.c`), never a speculative address.
- Stock's `ns2009_touch.ko` and `soc_fb.ko` were pulled read-only (`scp`) and disassembled with this
  project's own MIPS toolchain - never patched, never loaded onto custom, never modified on stock.
- Stock's own `guppyconfig.json` was hash-verified unchanged before and after the calibration fix on
  custom's copy.
- Every reboot cycle used the project's own established mechanisms (`write_ota_marker`,
  `flash-spare-slot.sh`'s own manifest/size/SHA256/md5 verification chain), never touching the
  currently-booted slot.
- One isolated bus-mode guess (`PARALLEL_666`, twice) and one isolated touch-GPIO fix were each
  tested, and kept or reverted strictly on physical result - never stacked with another unproven
  change in the same experiment.
- Classification: **`FUNCTIONAL_GUI_BASELINE`**, **`DISPLAY_DRIVER_FUNCTIONAL_BASELINE`**,
  **`TOUCH_DRIVER_FUNCTIONAL_BASELINE`**, **`USERSPACE_GUI_FUNCTIONAL`** - display root cause and
  touch root cause both confirmed and fixed; stock data integrity and A/B recovery preserved;
  application stack healthy. See `docs/GUI_WORKSTREAM_HANDOFF.md`.

## 60. USB host, storage, and the real webcam - working, and a genuine multi-session-old bug finally caught

**Starting premise questioned, and wrong.** An earlier session (§42) found that no external USB
device - flash drive, ethernet dongle - ever enumerated on this physical unit, on stock or custom,
and that finding was never revisited. Later docs (`docs/BOARD_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`,
`docs/BOOT_WARNING_AUDIT.md`) nonetheless described USB/camera as "proven live"/"confirmed live".
This session's first real evidence, gathered with a real USB flash drive and a real USB UVC webcam
both already connected at boot (so as not to lose whatever the boot log itself might show): a
completely clean `dmesg` - `dwc2` registers the root hub, an internal Genesys Logic hub (`05e3:0610`)
fans out to 4 ports, the webcam (`a108:2231`, "CCX2F3298") binds `uvcvideo` on port 1, and the flash
drive (`ffff:5678`, "Disk 2.0") binds `usb-storage` → SCSI → a real `/dev/sda` with real capacity
(15.7GB). `lsusb -t` confirms the same topology. **§42's finding is real for what it tested, but
outdated or incomplete now** - `OUTDATED_OR_INCOMPLETE_PRIOR_TEST`, not a regression, and not
something a fresh stock reboot was needed to prove given how directly this custom-side evidence
already contradicts it.

**The webcam's own two device nodes matter.** This SoC's own rotation/H.264-encode/H.264-decode M2M
blocks (`ingenic-rot`, `helix-venc`, `felix-vdec`) unconditionally claim `/dev/video0-2` at boot,
webcam attached or not - the real UVC device always lands at `/dev/video3` or later, confirmed via
`v4l2-ctl -d /dev/videoN --info`'s own "Device Caps" block (not the combined "Capabilities" summary
line, which misleadingly lists "Video Capture" for *both* the real capture node and its sibling
metadata-only node - this webcam exposes both `/dev/video3`, real capture + MJPEG, and `/dev/video4`,
metadata only, same driver, same card name). `S50webcam`'s old hardcoded `/dev/video0` assumption
(already flagged "unconfirmed against real hardware" in its own header comment) was simply wrong -
fixed with dynamic discovery (below).

**The real reason ustreamer had never actually run, ever, on this project, on any session**: a MIPS
ABI mismatch, not a USB problem at all. `pellcorp/k1-camera-build`'s own bundled toolchain
(`/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229`) produces binaries linked against glibc 2.29 with a dynamic-
linker request of `/lib/ld-linux-mipsn8.so.1` - this project's own Buildroot-built target rootfs uses
glibc 2.38 (`libc ABIs: MIPS_PLT UNIQUE MIPS_O32_FP64 ABSOLUTE MIPS_XHASH` per its own version
banner) with its real interpreter at plain `/lib/ld.so.1`. The two paths never matched, so the
kernel's own `execve()` always failed with ENOENT on the missing interpreter - BusyBox `ash` reports
this as a confusing "not found", easy to misread as "the file doesn't exist" when it's actually
"there's nobody who can load it". Every library the binary needed was correctly staged the whole
time (`readelf -d` NEEDED entries all resolved) - the binary itself just could never start. Never
caught before this session because no prior session had a real webcam physically attached to notice
the silence.

Fix: rebuild the exact same, untouched `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer` source (still pinned at
`18e30bb313d54b1b01dd995bd31ce5a3d5adffd6`, submodules unchanged, working tree clean, verified via
`git remote -v`/`git rev-parse HEAD`/`git submodule status` before touching anything) with this
project's own Buildroot-internal toolchain instead - the same one `chelper` and Moonraker's
`streaming-form-data` C extension already use - mirroring `docker.sh`'s own real build steps
(`jpeg-9d`, `libevent`, `libmd`, `libbsd`, then `ustreamer` itself) with `CC`/`AR`/`LD`/`STRIP`/
`--host=` swapped to the Buildroot triple. Two real environment snags along the way, neither related
to the ABI fix itself: `pellcorp/k1-bash-build`'s own `xz` binary has a broken `liblzma.so.5`
mismatch (worked around by decompressing the `.xz` tarballs on the host, where `xz` works fine,
before mounting them in); and naively prepending `/buildroot-host/bin` to `PATH` shadowed the
container's own working `automake` with Buildroot's own internal `automake-1.16` wrapper (broken
outside Buildroot's own build tree layout) - fixed by appending instead, since the cross-tool names
(`mipsel-buildroot-linux-gnu-*`) don't collide with anything already in the container's `PATH`.
Live-tested the rebuilt binary directly against `/dev/video3` before ever touching the build script's
committed state: real `--help` output (`Version: 7fe8c87; license: GPLv3` - straight from the binary
itself, further confirming the license correction below), a real `Capturing ...` log line, and a real
`GET /snapshot` returning `X-UStreamer-Online: true`/`Width: 640`/`Height: 480` headers with actual
JPEG bytes behind them.

**A second, unrelated real gap**: the flash drive's filesystem is exFAT (confirmed via the boot
sector's own `EXFAT` OEM signature - no partition table at all, a superfloppy layout), and
`/proc/filesystems` had no `exfat` entry - `CONFIG_VFAT_FS` was already on (so FAT32 drives already
worked), `CONFIG_EXFAT_FS` was not. Enabled via the fragment file, mainline's own driver (merged
since 5.4, not FUSE-based), following this project's own standing rule (fragment file, never a direct
in-place `.config` edit).

**A third gap, closing an already-known loose end**: the "camera macro warning" (`v4l2-ctl:
command not found`) from the Mainsail-warnings mission is a real one - this vendored Buildroot tree
(a trimmed vendor BSP subset) has no `v4l-utils` package at all. Rather than write a brand new
Buildroot package from scratch, built `v4l2-ctl` directly the same way as `ustreamer` - real upstream
`v4l-utils` pinned at tag `v4l-utils-1.20.0` (the last release before the 1.22 meson migration;
`pellcorp/k1-bash-build` has no python3/meson/ninja, so staying on autotools avoided adding that whole
toolchain for one diagnostic binary), `autoreconf`'d inside the container (needed `autoconf`/
`automake`/`libtool`/`gettext`/`autopoint`/`pkg-config` installed via `apt-get`, matching this
project's own already-established pattern for Moonraker's `pip download` step), configured minimal
(`--disable-libdvbv5 --disable-qv4l2 --disable-qvidcap --disable-gconv --disable-bpf
--disable-v4l2-ctl-libv4l`, no GUI, no libv4l2 conversion layer needed for basic diagnostics), built
just the `utils/v4l2-ctl` target. Live-tested: `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` correctly named all four
device groups (`jz-rot`, `CCX2F3298` with its two nodes, `vpu-felix`, `vpu-helix`) by their real
driver/card names, with the correct `/lib/ld.so.1` interpreter this time too.

**`S50webcam` rewritten** around real dynamic UVC discovery instead of the old hardcoded
`/dev/video0`: scans `/dev/video*`, keeps only nodes whose driver is `uvcvideo` *and* whose own
"Device Caps" block (not the combined summary) lists "Video Capture" *and* whose formats include
`MJPG`, rejecting the M2M/rotation/metadata-only nodes by construction. Runs as a small supervising
loop (5s bounded poll, not a busy loop, not full mdev/hotplug event wiring - this image doesn't
currently wire the kernel hotplug sysctl to `mdev` at all, and doing that is a bigger, more invasive
change to this whole image's device-management model than this mission's actual scope) so a webcam
that enumerates late, or is unplugged and replugged, gets picked up without a reboot; standard
`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status` interface via `start-stop-daemon`, `stop` cleanly kills both the
supervisor and any running `ustreamer` child. `--host` changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` -
`nginx`'s already-existing `/webcam/` reverse proxy is the only intended public entry point,
unchanged. Live-tested the full lifecycle (`start`/`status` showing both the supervisor and
`ustreamer` child `RUNNING` against the correct node/`stop` cleanly killing both/a live `GET
/snapshot` through the real supervised instance) before committing.

**License correction**: `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer`'s vendored `LICENSE` is the full GPLv3 text (also
confirmed at runtime, in the rebuilt binary's own `--help` banner) - every place in this project's
own documentation that called it "MIT-licensed" (§6, §10 above, this file; `README.md`) was wrong,
and has been corrected in place with a note, not silently rewritten.

## NEBULAOS_PRODUCTION_KERNEL_PREEMPTION - PREEMPT_RT documentation correction (2026-07-30)

Production boot/CPU/memory optimization mission, Phase 7. Corrects the claim made earlier in this
file (§ near line 836) that this project's kernel is a PREEMPT_RT real-time variant.

**What was claimed**: the `6.6.18-rt23` kernel release string was read as evidence this build uses
`CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT`, described as "a welcome side effect of using this SDK's own default config."

**What is actually true**, confirmed by reading the real running kernel's own compiled-in config
(`zcat /proc/config.gz` against the live device, not assumed from the version string):

```text
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=n   (not present in /proc/config.gz at all - never selected)
CONFIG_HZ=100
CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y
```

This is plain `CONFIG_PREEMPT` (voluntary/low-latency preemption), not `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT`. The
`-rt23` suffix in the release string comes from this SDK vendor's own kernel source lineage (the
tree it was forked from carries RT patches historically) - it says nothing about which Kconfig
options this project's own build actually turned on. NebulaOS's own kernel fragment
(`artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`) never touches
`PREEMPT`/`HZ`/`CPU_FREQ` at all; these are untouched SDK defaults, not a deliberate choice either
way.

Practically, this likely doesn't matter for print quality: Klipper keeps hard real-time step timing
on the MCU itself, not the host kernel, so host-side preemption latency was never on the critical
path. But no future decision should be made assuming real PREEMPT_RT guarantees exist on the host,
since none do today.

**PREEMPT_RT itself is not enabled or evaluated by this mission** - it is explicitly out of scope
here and deferred to a separate, later A/B engineering experiment that measures it head-to-head
against the current plain-PREEMPT baseline before any decision to ship it.

- Classification: **`PREEMPT_RT_DOCUMENTATION_CORRECTED`**, **`PRODUCTION_KERNEL_IS_PLAIN_PREEMPT`**,
  **`PREEMPT_RT_DEFERRED_TO_SEPARATE_AB_EXPERIMENT`** - no kernel behavior changed in this phase.

## WiFi firmware promotion: 7.46.58.13 replaced by 7.45.98.125 + matching CLM (2026-08-09)

Canonical CYW43430 WiFi firmware changed from `7.46.58.13` (control, extracted from this
project's own stock device) to `7.45.98.125` (Infineon build, FWID `01-f420b81d`, fetched
directly from `github.com/Infineon/ifx-linux-firmware`), after live hardware qualification
proved it stable and working end to end - see `docs/NEBULAOS_WIFI_125_ENGINEERING_TEST.md`'s
"Correction" section for the full incident record and evidence (an earlier same-day "not
viable" conclusion was itself wrong, caused by two non-overlapping test runs never actually
exercising `.125` together with its own matching CLM blob).

The fix that made this promotable: `.125` requires its own external CLM blob (no built-in
channel data), which must be embedded via `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` at the exact path
`brcm/brcmfmac43430-sdio.clm_blob` - the same rootfs-not-mounted-yet timing gap already closed
for `.bin`/`.txt`/`regulatory.db` (see §53 above), just not previously closed for the CLM.
`scripts/firmware/fetch-cyw43430-wifi-firmware.sh` now fetches both `.bin` and `.clm_blob`
together, pinned and hash-verified, as part of every normal build - no engineering-test flag,
no manual staging step. Board NVRAM is unaffected (byte-identical before and after, still
sourced from this repo's own release asset).

Obsolete engineering-test-only infrastructure removed from the tree as part of this promotion:
the old control-firmware/CLM fetch scripts, the manual apply/revert variant tool, the
temporary WiFi-specific stock-fallback failsafe, and the temporary `clmload_status` kernel
diagnostic patch. See `docs/NEBULAOS_WIFI_125_ENGINEERING_TEST.md` for what each one did and
why removing them doesn't lose any safety coverage (the existing, permanent
`S00revert-safety`/`S99confirm-good` OTA mechanism already covers "did this custom image boot
correctly" generally, WiFi included).
