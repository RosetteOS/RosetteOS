# RosetteOS Clean-Update + Virgin Baseline mission, Phase 4 (2026-08-08):
# on-demand factory-clean provisioning. Archives (never destroys)
# RosetteOS-owned persistent state, then leaves the namespace exactly as a
# genuinely new device's would be - S04rosetteos-factory-seed re-seeds
# everything fresh from THIS image's own archives on the very next boot.
#
# Deliberately lives under /opt (squashfs-resident, immutable) rather than
# under $ROSETTEOS_ROOT itself - it must remain available and correct even
# if the persistent application tree it operates on is damaged or absent.
#
# Scope, using the classification in docs/NEBULAOS_PERSISTENT_LIFECYCLE.md:
#   ARCHIVED + RESET : apps/{klipper,moonraker,mainsail,guppyscreen}
#                       (IMAGE OWNED), envs/{klipper,moonraker} (GENERATED,
#                       cheaper to reseed than to hand-classify), system/*
#                       (RosetteOS's own generation/known-good/activation
#                       metadata - itself neither user data nor printer
#                       output)
#   NEVER TOUCHED     : printer_data/config (USER OWNED - printer.cfg,
#                       macros, moonraker.conf), printer_data/{gcodes,logs,
#                       database} (GENERATED, but the user's own print
#                       history/output, not this mission's concern),
#                       updates/backups/maintenance directories, and every
#                       stock partition (mmcblk0p5/p7) - this script never
#                       issues a single write to /dev/mmcblk0* of any kind,
#                       structurally, by only ever operating on paths under
#                       $ROSETTEOS_ROOT.
#
# Usage:
#   factory-clean-provision.sh --archive-and-reset
#
# Without that exact flag, prints this usage and does nothing - there is
# no accidental/implicit destructive path.

Archives (does not delete) the current apps/, envs/, and system/ trees
under /usr/data/rosetteos to a timestamped backup directory, then recreates
an empty namespace so the next boot re-seeds everything fresh from this
image's own archives - exactly as a genuinely new device would.

printer_data/config (your printer.cfg, macros, moonraker.conf) and
printer_data/{gcodes,logs,database} are never touched. No stock partition
is ever written by this script.

Refuses to run while a print is active or an update transaction is in
flight. Requires a reboot afterward to actually take effect.
