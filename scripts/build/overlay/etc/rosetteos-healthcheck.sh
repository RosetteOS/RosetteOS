# NebulaOS mutable-runtime mission, Phase 8: two-stage update verification.
#
# Stage 1 (component health) is necessarily specific to what was just
# updated - see stage1_component() below, invoked with a component name.
# Stage 2 (full printer-stack health) is the same regardless of which
# component changed, and is safe to run standalone at any time (read-only
# queries only) - this is the part validated live in this pass, against
# the currently-running production Klipper/Moonraker, since it does not
# depend on Phase 7's mutable installs existing yet.
#
# Usage: rosetteos-healthcheck.sh stage1 <klipper|moonraker|mainsail> <path>
#        rosetteos-healthcheck.sh stage2

# processes with their own /server/info-style readiness state), Mainsail is
# static files served directly by nginx - "healthy" means nginx actually
# returns real content for it, not a stale/empty/error response. No process
# restart is needed for new static files to take effect (nginx re-reads the
# file from disk on every request), so this is safe to call immediately
# after a file-level activation swap, unlike Klipper/Moonraker's restart-then-
