# NebulaOS display sleep/wake touch watcher - the persistent background
# daemon side of the deferred sleep/touch-wake fields in
# /etc/nebulaos-display-qualified.sh (see that file's own
# ndq_apply_deferred_fields() for how/when this gets started, and this
# mission's own scope: this file builds the WAKE side only - polling the
# already-qualified touch driver's touch_down_count and issuing the
# backlight driver's "wake" command when a real touch is observed while
# asleep. It never triggers sleep itself; whatever future mechanism
# decides WHEN to sleep the display is explicitly out of scope here.
#
# ==========================================================================
# IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION - READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS FILE ON REAL
# HARDWARE, FIX HERE IF WRONG:
#
# The backlight driver's debugfs status file gaining a "sleep"/"wake"-
# capable asleep state is being added CONCURRENTLY by a different agent
# working in vendor/system, not yet visible from this checkout.
# This file was written against the command names `sleep`/`wake` and
# assumes the status file reports the asleep condition as the literal line
#     state: asleep
# (matching this exact driver's own existing convention of reporting
# other states the same way - e.g. "state: safe-on", "state: pwm-
# committed" - see ndq_apply_backlight()'s own grep pattern in
# /etc/nebulaos-display-qualified.sh for the precedent this follows).
#
# If the real, merged driver ends up using a different string for this
# state, the ONLY thing that needs to change is the pattern inside
# ndq_swc_backlight_is_asleep() below - nothing else in this file, or in
# S98nebulaos-display-sleep-wake-controller, or in the tests, depends on
# the exact string. That function is deliberately the single, isolated
# place this assumption lives.
# ==========================================================================
#
# Sourced by S98rosetteos-display-sleep-wake-controller. Also sourced
# directly by tests/rosetteos-display-sleep-wake-controller-tests.sh so
# there is exactly one copy of this logic, never a second one to drift out
# of sync - the same one-implementation-multiple-consumers pattern
# /etc/rosetteos-display-qualified.sh and /etc/rosetteos-camera-idle-
# controller.sh already both use.

# Sources the display-qualified library for ndq_get_field/ndq_is_uint/
# NDQ_CONFIG_FILE/NDQ_BACKLIGHT_STATUS_FILE/NDQ_BACKLIGHT_CMD_FILE/
# NDQ_TOUCH_STATUS_FILE - reused rather than re-parsing the config or
# re-declaring the debugfs paths a second time. Overridable so the offline
# test suite can point this at a fake library the same way every other
# caller of NDQ_LIB in this codebase already does.

# Poll interval, in (possibly fractional) seconds - this image's BusyBox
# `sleep` is built with CONFIG_FLOAT_DURATION=y (see

# enough that a human touching the screen while it is asleep perceives the
# wake as immediate (a few hundred ms is well under the threshold where a
# human notices input lag), while staying far from a busy-loop - this is a
# real-time printer control system sharing the same CPU, and this daemon
# only ever does meaningful work (a debugfs read, occasionally a debugfs
