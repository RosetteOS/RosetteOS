# NebulaOS display-qualification config: shared library for the persistent
# /usr/data/rosetteos/display-qualified.conf format, its atomic writer, its
# validator, and the debugfs-apply logic for the two kernel-owned drivers
# this mission qualifies:
#
#   - CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_FINAL_QUALIFICATION (commit 022d841),
#     debugfs at /sys/kernel/debug/ns2009_final_qualification/ - see
#     scripts/build/patches/touch-final-qualification.patch.
#   - CONFIG_NEBULAOS_BACKLIGHT_FINAL_CONTROLLER (commit 3993ca2), debugfs
#     at /sys/kernel/debug/nebulaos_backlight_final/ (NBLC_NAME, not the
#     driver's .c filename) - see
#     scripts/build/patches/backlight-final-controller.patch.
#
# Sourced by three callers: the boot-time apply script
# (etc/init.d/S97nebulaos-display-qualified-apply), the human-operator
# write helper (usr/libexec/nebulaos-display-qualified-write) that a real
# live-qualification session drives by hand over SSH, and this project's
# own offline test suite (tests/rosetteos-display-qualified-tests.sh) - one
# implementation, three consumers, so a fix or a field-list change only
# ever needs to happen in one place.
#
# Config format: plain "key=value" lines, one per line - NOT JSON. Same
# reasoning S05nebulaos-activate's own header already documents for its
# own working file: this is a BusyBox ash environment with no JSON-aware
# tool confirmed present, so a JSON writer/parser would mean either
# hand-rolling one (a real bug surface for a file this safety-critical) or
# taking a new build dependency. Plain key=value lines are trivially
# parsed with sed/grep/case, which are already relied on everywhere else
# in this codebase (S99confirm-good, nebulaos-healthcheck.sh, etc).
#
# SAFETY DEFAULT this whole file is built around: any parse/validate
# failure means "treat the file as absent" - the caller must then do
# nothing, leaving both kernel drivers in their own independently-safe
# boot defaults (touch poll-only, backlight boot-preserve). This library
# itself never applies a partial result - see ndq_validate()'s own
# all-fields-up-front design and ndq_apply_all()'s abort-on-first-failure
# sequencing.

# Atomic write
# ============================================================
#
# Contract: write to a temp file in the SAME directory as the target
# (guarantees the final rename is on the same filesystem, so it is a
# genuine atomic rename(2), not a cross-filesystem copy), fsync the temp
# file's data, rename() it over the target, then make the rename itself
# durable.
#
# File-content fsync: BusyBox's `dd conv=fsync` (CONFIG_DD=y, confirmed in
# vendor/system/buildroot/package/busybox/busybox.config) calls fsync() on
# its output file before exiting - already the established idiom in this
# codebase for exactly this (S03nebulaos-diskswap uses `dd ... conv=fsync`
# to durably write the swapfile). Reused here rather than inventing a new
# mechanism.
#
# Directory-entry fsync (durability of the rename itself, not just the
# file content): BusyBox ships no applet that fsyncs a directory file
# descriptor directly (no `flock`-style fd-holding primitive exposed to
# shell, and no dedicated "syncdir" tool) - the only two real options from
# a POSIX ash script are (a) a small compiled C helper that open()s the
# directory and calls fsync() on it, or (b) BusyBox's own `sync` applet,
# which calls the global sync(2) and flushes every dirty buffer in the
# system, directory metadata included. This project already uses plain
# `sync` for exactly this "make a just-completed on-disk change durable"
# purpose (S04nebulaos-factory-seed, twice, after its own seed-copy
# writes) - reusing that established, already-proven idiom instead of
# adding a new compiled helper binary to the image is the simpler, lower-
# risk choice for a config file this small that is written at most once
# per live-qualification session (a rare, human-operator-driven action,
# never a hot path) - the cost of a full sync() is irrelevant here.

# Only ever called after ndq_validate succeeded. Always transitions to
# safe-on first, regardless of backlight_mode - re-reading the driver's
# own state machine (nebulaos_backlight_final_controller.c): "pwm-active"
# is only reachable from "safe-on" (nblc_cmd_pwm_active() rejects with
# -EPERM from any other state), and "enter-safe-on" is documented as the
# universal, always-valid convergence command from ANY state including
# boot-preserve. Command spellings below are copied verbatim from
# nblc_command_write()'s strcmp() whitelist in the patch - not guessed.
#
# IMPORTANT, HONEST LIMITATION (found while reading the real driver, not
# assumed): pwm-active-25/50/75 are BOUNDED, auto-reverting operations.
# nblc_cmd_pwm_active() arms the driver's own kernel watchdog for
# NBLC_PWM_TEST_MS (2000ms) before applying the duty, and
# nblc_restore_work() unconditionally converges back to safe-on when that
# timer fires - there is no debugfs command in this driver that leaves the
# backlight in a SUSTAINED, non-safe-on PWM brightness. This script issues
# the qualified pwm-active-<N> command exactly once and does not loop or
# reissue it: the mission's core safety principle ("never leave the screen
# possibly-dark for even a moment") is still fully satisfied either way,
# since the auto-revert target is safe-on (lit), never off. Sustained PWM
# brightness control is simply not a capability this kernel driver
# exposes yet - recording pwm_channel/pwm_period_ns/pwm_polarity/
# safe_brightness in the config is still valuable as an audit trail of
# what was qualified, and forward-compatible with a future driver
# revision that does support a sustained mode.
