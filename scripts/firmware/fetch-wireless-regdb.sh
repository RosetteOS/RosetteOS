# Stages regulatory.db/regulatory.db.p7s under scripts/build/overlay/lib/firmware/
# so CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE can bake them directly into the kernel image (see
# artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/halley5-rosetteos-fragment.config) -
# cfg80211 requests these before the SquashFS rootfs is mounted, so having
# them correctly packaged in the rootfs alone (via Buildroot's own
# BR2_PACKAGE_WIRELESS_REGDB, already enabled) isn't sufficient; see
# docs/BOOT_WARNING_AUDIT.md's regulatory.db entry for the full trace.
#
# Deliberately mirrors the exact version Buildroot's own wireless-regdb
# package pins (vendor/system/buildroot/package/wireless-regdb/wireless-regdb.mk,
# WIRELESS_REGDB_VERSION), fetched from the same BR2_KERNEL_MIRROR-relative
# path, so the copy staged here and the copy Buildroot installs into the
# rootfs are byte-identical - not two independently-sourced regulatory
# databases that happen to agree today.
#
# Unlike the proprietary WiFi firmware fetch-cyw43430-wifi-firmware.sh
# handles, wireless-regdb is ISC-licensed and freely redistributable - but this is
# still a fetch-and-verify script, not a committed binary, so a version bump
# is a deliberate, reviewable diff to this script rather than a silent binary
# swap in git history.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/firmware/fetch-wireless-regdb.sh [cached-tarball-path]
# With no argument, downloads fresh. With an argument, verifies and uses that
# local file instead of hitting the network (offline-cache path) - still
# checked against the same pinned hash either way.
